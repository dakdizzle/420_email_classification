shift.portland@enron.com,shift.portland@enron.com,shift.portland@enron.com,Subject: Congestion Wheels.,Hey Guys.The ISO cutting our off-peak imports from PV has been an ongoing problem. Now that we are doing congestion wheels again we can finally do something to avoid these cuts using congestion wheels. Normally the ISO will cut our Import and shift our load from NP15 (PGE1&2&3) across the path to relieve the congestion. If you submit a congestion wheel there cannot be $30 cong,  thus they will not cut your schedule going in at PV.  Instead of shifting your load the ISO will award your congestion wheel and everybody will be happy. It is important to make your wheel larger then your import to ensure that part of your import not getting cut. I would recommend to put in the max number of MW's you think you can buy in the North and get rid of in the Desert. Go big in the off-peak, we submitted 200MW wheels Saturday and I think its safe to do similar size most nights.  Geir

Cascade is a tie between CISO and PAC SYSTEM on the California Oregon border. There is currently 30MW Non-Firm Hourly transmission available on the tie.The capacity constraint is on the PacifiCorp side of the tie,  and you can find the real number available on the PAC oasis site. Check under TRANSMISSION REQUESTS/ Offerings. The path name you need to check is W/PPW/CRAG-PACW//. Make sure you pick Hourly non-firm. On the CISO side the tie point is called CASCAD_1_CRAGVW by the CISO. Procedure:Export at Cascade from the CISO. Buy PAC Transmission from CRAG to BPAT or whoever is picking it up from Pac System. Transmission costthrough PAC is only $5.84.I know the NP15/MIDC spread is not as large as we have seen it in the past. It does on the other hand give us another option.Geir

portland.shift@enron.com,portland.shift@enron.com,portland.shift@enron.com,Subject: NCPA BR IS BACK,Hey Guys. I had a long talk with NCPA today and set up so that we again can do the ZP26/NP15 Buy-Resale on a Realtime basis. We are not doing a profit split this time, we are paying them $25/MW instead. This basically enables us to shift 21MW across PATH15 and not be subject to Congestion as NCPA has Grandfather Rights across the path. This is a sweet strategy when the SP15/NP15 spread is there and PATH15 is congested. NCPA's capacity is 21MW, but I would not recommend doing more than 20MW. There are others who know about this opportunity but are not currently using it (WESCO especially). So by doing only  20MW we do not remind them of NCPA. The way this works is that we call NCPA and ask their capacity across PATH15. And tell them you want to schedule the BR through whatever hour. IN CAPS:We sell to NCPA in ZP26.  We buy from NCPA in NP15.We can buy SP15 to fill our ZP26 sale (we just shift the load from SP15 to ZP26, so enter a EPMI CALPOOL).PG&E is NCPA's SC, so if you are not passing Phase two give them a call.NCPA's tel#: (916) 786-3520PG&E tel# : (415) 973-1969If you guys have any questions  just ask me.Geir

Right now Sierra Pacific will only let us schedule 12MW on the tie so do not try to schedule any more (The tie is only good for 17MW).- Either do a export from SP15 to Silverpeak or put in a wheel going out at Silverpeak(From PV or FC).- Buy transmission from SPP from  (www.swoasis.com ) CONTROL TO HILLTOP. ($6.90 on-peak, $3.90 off-peak)- Buy transmission from PAC from MAL2 TO MAL5. ($5.84)- Buy transmission from BPA from HILLTOP TO SNOHO or another Sink. (Account numbers below).We need to bounce this of SNOHO before we send it back in at Malin. THIS SCHEDULE NEEDS TO BE TAGGED OR SIERRA PACIFIC GETS VERY PISSED OFF, THEY ARE NOT USED TO DOING TO MUCH REAL TIME. THERE IS A TEMPLATE FOR THIS SCHEDULE SO IT SHOULD NOT BE HARD. Call and confirm the request with both PAC and Sierra.Also do not sell to a marketer(especially POWEREX) without sleeving. We do not want anybody else to know about the path. If Powerex sees this I guarantee that they would try to schedule this and we do not want competition. Right now the only person using the tie is SOCAL EDISON and they are flowing 12MW into Cali, going the opposite way of us way.  It is available 24hrs a day so lets take advantage of it as much as we can.If you have any questions over the weekend call me.Account numbers:SPP - PAC: 853724SPP-SNOHO: 853703SPP-PUGET: 853725Geir
