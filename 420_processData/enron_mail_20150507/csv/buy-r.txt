Counterparties are very nervous and many are not extending us credit so we are having to prepay extensively to do business, both in the US and UK. I have two suggestions:-allocate to each business a fraction of our available liquidityor-appoint someone to make the call when a large chunk of cash is needed.For example, EGM wants to send out $200- $300 million for sixty days to buy physical to cover an option with Koch. We do not have infinite liquidity and we need to address it fast. I will try to set up a meeting tomorrow.Rick

Can you prepare a brief presentation that would serve as a discussion document for such a meeting. The concept is that a deal flows into a website?? that is basically a checklist and the transaction is sized and scoped. If it met deal criteria and portfolio requirements, it would flow directly to an outside shop that would fund, bill, track etc. Enron could possibly keep a small interest in economics and of course a skim. Lets review presentation, then discuss with Ben/Andy and Janet D.  and proceed to banks. Ben is clearing idea with Delaney. We are shooting for a Friday (23) meeting.Thanks, Rick

As you know, a remaining issue involves who is responsible for these types of hedges Corp or business unit.   The currency traders on Hickerson's desk contacted me today.  They mentioned that it is an appropriate time to put a currency hedge in place for 3 reasons:1.) The spot rate has fallen back to the 1230 KRW/USD level2.) The forward rate is relatively flat as there is no signifcant difference in 1 year rates between the two currencies.3.) Option volatilities have decreased significantly over the past month.Please let me know if (when?) we should discuss this issue further.

There was considerable discussion which I have summarized below.Returns: were the returns sufficient to syndicate the risk. I answered positively, which is what the capital price addresses. The dash return is a blended debt and equity return.(?)Was the $19 million excess proceeds enough to allow the company to operate. I answered yes since 85% of reserves are producing and little capital will be needed to develop pdnp and pud reserves.Is management capable of operating or will they be in chapter 11 again soon. I answered that the bankruptcy was a result of overpaying for Wyoming deal and low commodity prices last two years which resulted in a bb decrease below outstanding. We will have to watch this issue carefully.Are banks reluctant to support KCS and could this cause a liquidity problem? Answered that all creditors were made whole and likely that someone will come into credit but it was a risk, although for the time being they had enough cash to operate.This feedback is just for fyi but it does indicate that board is active and not a rubber stamp.

Following are my thoughts. First, I am not going to Netco. (Long story). Second, I have spoken with Ken Lay and Jeff McMahon about the continuation of RAC and my leading it. They both want RAC to continue and want me to lead it and also combine an internal audit function with RAC as well (to be determined more definitively). Jim has also requested that some RAC folks be near his operation as you have which I totally understand. I think I will assign a couple people to his floor but keep the bulk of our operation on 28. We have counterparty credit files on 15,000 counterparties as well as Dash libraries and other info that require large secure space.My final issue is that I have had three credit people leave this week so my situation is getting critical. I need to get Netco people away from 28 and get remaining RAC people sitting together and feeling like a team. Everyone is looking and the market is hot for our credit and market risk people. I hope this addresses your issue.Rick

A big concern Enron has now is that we have $7 billion of int'l assets and the fear is that we lose people and no one will be around to monitor and operate these assets.

Before Janet D. left she had requested additional resources and we began making arrangements to get people in place. We have assigned Tracy Ngo, Ed Sacks, Paul Radous and Wendy Conwell to power. We also have moved other RAC people into credit, Mark Ruane (VP), Ken Curry (Dir), and Carol North (Mgr). Unfortunately it takes some time to get these people trained on transactional credit issues but they should come along quickly. We are in the market for more.It might be helpful to know if we could clone Tracy, how many would you need, given your plans in the market. Tracy is one of our best people. Also, does being in Houston work or do we need resources in Portland. I'll meet w/ Tracy next week when she is in Houston and get her views as well. Please don't hesitate to let me know if we aren't keeping up and of course if you are gearing up for a new market push and anticipate additional needs let us know ASAP because there is a 12 month or so training period required for a strong performer to get up the Enron curve.

on making a difference to people severely impacted by the recent flood "Allison".  All business units and Corporate functions will be participating in a Day of Caring, teaming with the following United Way agencies: Jewish Community Center, YMCA, Neighborhood Centers, and Center for the Retarded.  The Corporate functions and EGAS employees' Day of Caring is on Wednesday, August 8, 2001, and we will be teaming with the Jewish Community Center to provide assistance to senior citizen meals-on-wheels beneficiaries.  Activities that will be completed that day include painting, yard work, landscaping, cleaning, and various home repairs.The Jewish Community Center provides community services to individuals regardless of religious orientation.  These services include: childcare, youth development, summer day camp, meals-on-wheels and congregate meals to the elderly, health and recreation programs, dance, drama and music programs, refugee services and other community services.  The Jewish Community Center is responsible for providing approximately 40% of Houston/Harris County meals-on-wheels per day.  Funding comes from a combination of federal and state programs, the United Way and individuals.I encourage every single employee  to take at least half of your day on August 8th to participate in this effort.  RAC's goal is 100% participation.  It is a unique opportunity to truly make a difference in someone's quality of life, and you will be able to see first hand how your United Way contributions improve the lives of people in our own community.  Below are our United Way contacts within each group that will be helping with this process and can answer any questions.  Please sign up with your team leader by designating whether you are interested in participating for a full day, or for which half of the day, and they will review with each function's department head to ensure appropriate RAC coverage for that day's responsibilities.  Thank you in advance for volunteering your time.  Let's show everyone that RAC is dedicated to helping those that are less fortunate.RickEnron Corp.

First of all, Monday morning, each of you should have received a small package of Lego building blocks and a schedule of United Way activities for the week.  The building blocks symbolize Enron's commitment to "Building Houston's Future" with the United Way and the schedule outlines the coming activities that Enron employees will be engaging in to show support for the United Way Agencies and the Houston community.To highlight this week's activities:On Wednesday, August 8, many of our RAC colleagues will be participating in the 2001 Enron Days of Caring.  The Enron Corporate Team, of which RAC is a large and important part, will be providing assistance to the Jewish Community Center.  If you have already volunteered to play a role in this activity--thank you.  If you have not had an opportunity to volunteer and would like to, please contact any one of this year's RAC United Way Campaign Coordinators--Cindy Hudler, Rebecca Phillips, Darren Vanek, Shelli Smith, Becky Caudle, Cassandra Schultz or Chip Schneider.On Friday, August 10, Enron will host an Appreciation Event in Antioch Park which will include a complimentary lunch from Chick-Fil-A and activities to celebrate Enron employee efforts during the week.  Included in this event will be the Building Block Challenge contest featuring managers from around Enron including Dave Gorte and Chip Schneider on the Corporate Team.  Please plan on coming out to join-in the celebration and support our colleagues.Of course, underlying all of the planned activities is the financial need that the Houston area United Way Agencies have for the Year 2002.  This year has been extraordinary due to the flooding and devastation experienced by the Houston area during Tropical Storm Alison.  In addition to providing their typical day-to-day community services, many United Way Agencies played a crucial role in the recovery effort and still provide support to those affected by the storm.  A contribution to the United Way this year is as important as ever given the extraordinary need.  Remember approximately $0.90 out of every $1.00 go directly to benefit our friends, neighbors and fellow citizens in the Houston area.  I sincerely encourage you to support RAC's objective of 100% participation in this aspect of the Campaign by making a contribution.  Contributions can be made by clicking on the Enron Human Resources website at https://hrglobal.enron.com.Thanks for your support. Best regards,Rick

We should shut these offices down because we can not control them. They don't make much money and will be a huge negative after losses at Long Beach.---or----2. We establish a rigid template for how these offices operate. My thought is that we create a McDonalds Hamburger type operation. Each office is exactly the same and operates under precise and well communicated rules. "Hamburger" quality is monitored from Houston routinely.There are a huge number of these remote offices so we need to address how we proceed.Any thoughts? Rick

It does not sound like this lady has her act together. I wish I knew more about biomedical engineers. You should talk to the head of the dept. and ask who is big in the industry and send them all letters with a resume attached. Don't worry at all about your resume right now, it is almost irrelevant. Your grade point average and salutatorian are relevant. There are very few female engineers in the workplace which will help you a lot. You could work for companies like Enron, Exxon, Shell for example but it would not be in your major. My guess is the major pharmaceutical firms may hire you but you need to research this. The first stop should be the head of the department. Lets talk more on this topic. Love, Dad

Essentially, the credit guy (Frank Hilton) is hurting us in the market and anything you can do to help is appreciated.

Lots of our efforts in the past building systems, procedures and infrastructure pay off in times like these. Feedback from both Citibank and JPM/Chase and Enron's Board members has been very positive relative to RAC. Congratulations to all.On another note I want to caution everyone in the group from making negative statements in the presence of ours and other groups, especially more junior members of these groups. Because they come from RAC they are not considered idle commentary and can be, and have been, damaging to morale to these people. We all speculate about the state of affairs and it is a good stress relief but we can not be a part of morale reducing behavior.Things are not back to normal but they are improving. Upon receipt of commitment from banks, hopefully later today or early tomorrow, our short term issues should be resolved. Lots of activities are underway to address medium term and long term solutions. In the mean time, keep smiling.Rick
