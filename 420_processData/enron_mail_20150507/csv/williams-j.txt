Cook & Associates, PC.I know, I know, the end of an era, you thought you felt the earth slowlygrinding to a halt, etc. etc.  I just had to realize I was just a legendin my own mind.I'm moving to the big leagues - I'll be the 35ish employee at MGL Consultin=gwww.mglconsulting.com - the firm provides comprehensive registration andcompliance services to broker/dealers, investment advisors and insurancecompanies.  I'm coming on board to manage the growth of the company throughfinancial forecasting, modeling and planning as well as being billablein a role of support for our associate securities attorneys in litigatedmatters involving securities - both for and against brokers.MGL is around the corner from Hewitt Associates in The Woodlands - sothe Suz and I will probably carpool (or walk) to work!Although it has been a difficult decision to sever my career from Larry,the opportunity at hand versus the current utility was too great.  Wewill remain the best of friends, and as such, will have ready access toone another as this transition occurs.For those of you fortunate enough to be clients....I will no longer beable to serve you in a manner consistent with what you should expect asI will not be immersed in the day to day operations of the retail financialworld and the information that comes with that.  However, for those ofyou not aware, Larry has always reviewed and been aware of all our accounts=. Therefore, you can expect him to continue to monitor and advise you onyour portfolio and planning for years to come.  You do have options: 1)do nothing and everything continues as is  2) move your account to anotherbroker  3) change your account to no broker or to another broker of record.  With any of these options we'll be more than happy to accommodate.Larry is available if you'd like to meet and/or visit with him at anytime.  Larry and I will continue to work together on clients that I'minvolved with for as long as necessary (i.e. if you still want to placetrades through me or contact me to resolve a move or initiate a rollover,etc., that's more than great!)Most of my contact information remains the same:home 281-362-1379mbl 281-794-6300internet email danaltom@hotmail.compresumed new work email daltom@mglconsulting.commgl main line 281-367-0380DanPS Since I rarely send out a mass email, I'll take the opportunity toshamelessly advance the Suz and I's other activities - we've opened anart gallery in Old Town Spring, come by and visit us - www.creeksidecollect=ion.com=20

Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. (You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Its in the system as Max SIQ for both companies, and the 10301 DIQ for Peoples only, No DIQ for NS.  This could change slightly in the morning, but my guess is it won't.  I already balanced out Will Co and Other City gates and took 72000 to Peoples.  Kelly needs to buy at least the short at amarillo.

jeff.davis@enron.com,jeff.davis@enron.com,jeff.davis@enron.com,Subject: ,Jeff,	Sorry for all the resumes lately, but everyone wants to get their foot in the door at Enron.  This resume is from my wife's cousin, who is looking to get a summer internship at Enron.  She is a very sharp young lady with a great work ethic.  I don't know if you are hiring for internships, if not, could you please forward this on to the person hiring for those positions.  I greatly appreciate any help you could give.  Let me know if you have any further questions.  Thanks again for your help.Laura Perkins - resumefinal.doc
