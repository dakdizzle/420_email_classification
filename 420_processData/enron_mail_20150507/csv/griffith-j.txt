I guess the reason I was a little upset is that I feel that we are a family here.  I spend more time with you guys than I do with my wife.  I felt a little betrayed.  I should not have felt that way.  You guys have given me the oppurtunity of a lifetime, I am very thankful for that.  I have never questioned the importance of you or Mike of anyone on our desk.  Please forgive me if I have been a little down.  I think that I am truly okay now.  It has been a very emotional couple of weeks with everything going on.  I know we will get through this.  I once again want to tell you that I am here for anything that needs to be done.  You will not here about this situation again.  Thank you for understanding.  I put my total trust in you.  John

john.arnold@enron.com,john.arnold@enron.com,john.arnold@enron.com,Subject: ,X-FileName: JGRIFFIT (Non-Privileged).pstJohn,As you are aware, there was some confusion on the 2 Peoples trades we did on 10/15/01.  We did not find out there could be a problem until yesterday, 15 days after the trade was input into the system.  I consider this unacceptable so I wanted to find out what happened to our processes internally.  A person named Richard in the physical confirm area was the one that let Amy know the trade wasn't a financial trade but a physical trade.  I called him to ask him why it took 15 days to find this out.  He said that the deal was entered into as a financial deal so he didn't know about the trade until yesterday.  The person in charge of financial confirms is Diane Anderson and I called her to ask what happened.  She said she didn't know but would check into it.  She left me a message yesterday evening saying that for about 5 days in October they were shorthanded and they didn't confirm any financial trades.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE,  especially in the situation we are currently in.  I haven't talked to her again but I wanted you to know about this.  Not to put any more problems on your desk, but this needs to be fixed.Amy yesterday found a person at Peoples that knows the trades as we know them (financial).  So the trade is okay, but it could have been a $500,000 hit to Mike's book.Please let me know if I can do anything.  Thanks.John

Thanks.John"Here is the announcement: Reliant Energy Weather Risk Management Group has developedWeather-sensitive Gas Load Indices ("WGLI"),  indices that measure nationalor regional residential and commercial gas consumption during the heatingseason. We believe the indices will provide valuable information for gastraders as well as other market participants.  We plan to make a swapmarket in the indices in the near future. We hope the WGLI swaps willbecome a new financial tool to help you or your clients to better managetheir risks associated with the fluctuation of gas demand."
greg.couch@enron.com,greg.couch@enron.com,greg.couch@enron.com,Subject: ,Greg,I want to thank you so much for all you work on the trade blotter.  We are getting close here.  I put together a list of items to get the thing completely operational.  Below is the list and maybe we could talk today to discuss.  Thanks.BLOTTER - rearrange the deal input screen - have Amy's sheet pull deals from access database - get Mike Maggi's computer set up for the access database - build a spreadsheet to take a snapshot of the blotter for Mike Maggi - set up a default month for the deal input screen (possibly an input on the spreadsheet) - have deal input screen popup on the screen that the spreadsheet is open in - on morning macro, include clear trades, clear charm, clear theta and clear recon numbers - separate price and vol on the Fetch Curves button - delete evening macro - add button for settle prices - add button to print position, pnl, options and swap pages (one button) - test multiple user input on the deal input spreadsheetThis list might look like alot, but I think most items will only take a few minutes to correct or change.  Let me know when you get a chance to sit down and talk about this.  Thanks.John Griffith

I think that if I was still in structuring then I might be worried, but I am trading natural gas options and the desk I work for has been very profitable.  I think that the natural gas and power trading floors are the main reason they bought us.  I would think they would like to keep things as they are on these desks, but you never know.
