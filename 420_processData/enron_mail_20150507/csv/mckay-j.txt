ackertdm@yahoo.com,ackertdm@yahoo.com,ackertdm@yahoo.com,Subject: RE: long time no talk,Hello,Your right it has been a long time since we have chatted.  Things are a cha=nge'n with my life.First I just got back from a little (so called) vacation where Beth and I d=rove from West Palm Beach to Houston.  We did it over 3 days so it wasn't t=hat bad.  Day one was a 10 hour hop from West Palm to Desitn, Fl.  You woul=d have loved Destin, they have the most amazing sand on their beaches.  It =kind of reminds me of Icing Sugar.  Very white and has a very fine texture,= and I felt like I was sink right into the sand. www.holidayinndestin.com. = Next stop was in New Orleans, which ended up with lots of drinks and some =pretty good Cajun food.  It took about 6 hrs to get there from Destin but t=he traffic was not that bad.  Next stop was in Houston (about 5.5 hrs) from= New Orleans.  By now I'm sure you have asked yourself.."Why did they do th=is drive?"  And the obvious answer is because Beth is moving there.  She re=nted a really nice loft in down town Houston not far from Enron Field http:=//astros.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/hou/ballpark/hou_ballpark_history.jsp.  She too=k a job with Enron Energy Service which is our retail company.  The bad thi=ng is I'm not sure how I feel about having her work for the same company. T=he good thing is that she is in a different building than the Wholesale gro=up so the chances of having my personal life and business life cross are lo=w.  I guess this would kind of be like if we worked for Shell and I ran the= Bulk dealer ship and she was responsible for exploration.  Not the same bu=siness but none-the-less for the same company.Second,  It look like I am going to sell my house and probably end up movin=g to Houston as well.  Believe it or not this was not by design, just a mer=e coincident.  However, it has presented some tough questions.  Do I really= want to move again? and Do I want to co-habitate?  Moving is the easy part=, I'm starting to become an expert, and I was thinking about selling my hou=se anyway.  As for co-habitating, the jury is still out.  Beth would have n=o problem with the idea, but, Cold feet McKay has mixed feeling.  Co-habiat=ion is in the lead as it stands.Third, What would you prefer I do with some of the goodie's you have let me= borrow. ie Your beautiful dolls, the cabinets the dolls are in, the TV sta=nd, you mirror, and the other few remaining items.  I thought I would store= the dolls at Carol's, but I was unsure as to what your preference was for =the other things.   I am going to sell everything I can and start over in H=ouston regardless my living plans (the only thing I'm going to try to take =is my car).  If you want I can either try to get a fair price for you furni=ture or Stephen might be able to make good use of the TV Cabinet and other =things.  Email me your phone number as I do not have it, and we can talk ab=out what is best.Anyway, good to hear you are getting some exercise (I am trying to do the s=ame), and stay off the darts if you can.  If you cann't, reward yourself fo=r trying!Take care and I will talk to you in a couple of weeks.Love,Jon =20

As a temporary solution I created a filer under my master user Id that gives them all physical Alberta gas products one month and under.

No one should want to harm the Canadian working for the Swiss company.Actually, my division was sold to UBS so the transition should not be that hard.  Mostly the same people, but on a much smaller scale.  If I could make the same amount of money for UBS I did for Enron last year, I'd finally get the Bonus I've always been looking for.  Anyways,  I'll keep you posted.  My Email hasn't changed yet, but I'm sure it will.  If you need to get in contact with me try, Bjenkins2@houston.rr.comHow's the personal life going?  I hope all is well.Jon

Structuring needs you Gas Daily Daily offer for 30 peak day at TETCO M3.  You previously indicated US$0.13 for 40,000 a day and it looks like they are going to do the whole volume.  They will notify you by 9:00 am the day before delivery.I don't know what the right price is but it would seem that we could anticipate their need to call and get in front of  the market moves.  I am going to stick with the 0.13/mmbtu unless I hear from you.I hope the vacation is going well.  Sorry to disturb you.Regards,Jon

I still have not quite cleaned up my affairs in Calgary and probably need to do a weekend trip back up there, but I'll be sure to give you more notice than last time, as it will probably be less work and more play.  I have yet to do anything too spectacular down here.  Last week end I went to the Houston Grand Prix.  Paul Tracey and the other Canadian (name fails me....you know the french guy Patrick?????) didn't do to well.  Although, Enron had sponsored a car for that race and it  was in 3rd most of the way until it crashed on the 2nd from last lap.  It was kind of fun to have someone to cheer for in the race that was in the "thick" of things.  The day was nice and it beat being inside all day.A couple of week before that I watched Notre Dame get slaughtered by Texas A&M.  It was a really hot day and Kyle Field (where A&M plays) is the loudest outdoor stadium I have ever been in.  There was 92,000 people there and 91,950 were die hard Texas A&M fans.  I kept pretty quite though, the only thing I had to cheer about  as far as the Irish was concerned was that they won the coin toss.  Everything else was down hill from there........it was a complete domination by A&M.The apartment is starting to get organized.  It is hard to take two 2,000 square foot homes and move them into one 950 square foot apartment.  I've thrown a lot of stuff out I hope I wont need again or I hope I can replace easily if I need it.How are things with you?  Are you guys getting out much these days?  Anything new and exciting going on in your life?I hope all is well and I find myself missing you guys a lot.  Have one for me!Jon

Things down south seem to have taken a turn for the worse.  Enron keeps making headlines, and not in a good way.  It looks like the market is going to test the big E and make sure that we can handle a little adversity.  Life down here is ok, I am still trying to get settled.  Living with the girlfriend is going pretty well except for the two cats she has.  I can not stand them, and if I could find a way to make them disappear I would.  Cats are the most useless, dirty animals in the world and her cats prove it everyday.Anyways, I've been doing some fun things down here.  I have gone to a couple of college football games.  I saw Texas AM crush Notre Dame, and the University of Texas kill Colorado.  Both, games were fun to go to and the weather was nice for both of them so I can't complain.   I also went to the Grand Prix of Houston.  That day was also nice and it was fun to watch, but as far as car races go it was not that exciting.  The winner lead start to finish and no one was close all day.  The two Canadian drivers both crashed relatively early so even trying to cheer for people from the homeland didn't go that well.  Other than those few days the weather has been pretty uncomfortable.  Hot and sticky, its like sitting outside and watching the rodeo.  You just don't feel clean when you get back inside.Trading has been hard.  I've been on a long cold spell and I need to turn it around soon.  But, it always looks its darkest before dawn......bring on the light. I hope everything is going well for you.  Sorry to hear the ladies are not plentiful.  Usually that is one of the big upsides to going back to school.  Good Luck on you exams, I'm sure you'll do fine.Regards,Jon

Given that we are coming to the end of the heating season our best opportunities to make money over the next little while will be with respect to storage, storage arbitrage, and opportunities surrounding the injection season.   Having this in mind I think the best place to start is with the pipe that has the most storage capabilities and flexibility, and I think that is Columbia Gas Transmission.  I am inviting everyone to attend a meeting Tuesday at 3:00 (location to follow) to discuss the who, what, where, when, why, and how.   In preparation for the meeting we need to have information regarding the pipe:1)	We need the operational capabilities of the pipe.   This should include major receipt points, delivery points, through put capability, line pack balances, and storage facilities (both owned by the pipeline as well as third parties).  Expect to discuss which regions are the bottle necks, and what operational restrictions or advantages individual locations have. (Rob, Meredith, Bob or Chris could you please try to track down some of this info)2)	We need to talk about trading and transacting in this region.  Proper contracts with the pipe, what flexibility we have (or could get), transportation costs within the region, etc....(Rob, Meredith, Bob or Chris could you please try to track down some of this info)3)	Major players on the pipeline LDC's, Industrials, Power Generators, and production companies (i.e.. native production on the pipe) (Adam and Chuck could you please gather this info)4)	Price Curves and trading opportunities for the region.  (I will be supplying the data for this part of the discussion)Please come ready to talk freely about what you know and please understand that the point of this is to figure out what pieces of information we lack and to make everyone better informed.  I look forward to see you all on Tuesday.Regards,Jon

gmille@ca.ibm.com,gmille@ca.ibm.com,gmille@ca.ibm.com,Subject: ,Glen,So its time for Monday night football and I was thinking about how you'd hi=tting on some waitress at Hooters.  Ahhhhh those were the days!   How are t=hings going?  What's new in the world?  Things here seem to be running ther=e course.  Remember the movie Wall Street where they arrest "Bud Fox" for i=nsider trading and it is the beginning of the end.  Well I think Bud might =have worked here, and the whole company seems to be coming down with him.  =I don't know if it is getting much press in Canada but the mighty Enron has= fallen on hard times and we are in the process of merging with another com=pany down here as a way of staying afloat.  We seem to have run out of cash= and can't pay the bills.  Visa and Mastercard are maxed out.  Its kind of =got me soul searching and I'm trying to decided what to do next.  I can sta=y where I am and wait and see what comes of the merger, but its kind of lik=e sticking with the Expo's, no one is certain what the future is. Or, I can= try and jump ship, catch on with another gas trading company, but the prob=lem is the grass is Never as green on the other side of the fence.  Hence t=he soul searching and dilemma.  Anyway, I just thought I'd drop you a note,= see how things are going.  Dolphins seem to be doing ok, 6-2, life could b=e worse.I'm going to Tampa Bay for American Thanksgiving and kind of looking forwar=d to the couple of days off.  And I'm coming to Calgary for Christmas.  I g=et in late Friday the 21st and head back to Houston Sunday the 30th.  Maybe= we could get everyone together and go skiing one day, drinks at minimum.  =Anyway I have to get back to work.  I hope all is well in Cow town and say =hi to one of the waitress for me tonightJon

frank.hayden@enron.com,frank.hayden@enron.com,frank.hayden@enron.com,Subject: RE: Canadian office,Frank,By not being able to trade C$ denominated products we would not be able to trade most of the physical products including cash, one month, index gas, or be able facilitate long term structures.  Having said that, if the time period for not trading these products was only 45 days, they could get past that without any major damage being done.  It will take longer to get physical contracts in place in Canada than it will financial.  The extra time the Canadian office would have before it traded physical C$ products would allow them to obtain a critical mass of trading counter parties.  If it was going to be 120 or 180 days, then there would be problems.I hope this helps, let me know if you need any else.Regards,Jon

But, I do not think that the trend has changed.  In my humble opinion, I think that the number was probably an adjustment of over statements of inventory over the past 8 weeks. I do not believe that the number should have any baring on the numbers going forward.I still expect us to trend down, but it will probably take an extra week to recover from this move.Regards,Jon
