galen.torneby@enron.com,galen.torneby@enron.com,galen.torneby@enron.com,Subject: Lake Worth Activities,X-FileName: MCASH (Non-Privileged).pstThe contents of this email are privileged and confidential.Below is a quick summary of the general guidance provided by Mark Stubley during the conference call today.  If you have questions, please feel free to give me a call at 713-853-6401.IBEW, Pipefitters, and others have tried to "salt" jobs down there in Florida.The business agents will try to get out early and visit with the site manager to get a pre-hire agreement, if possible.  The business managers will take notes/keep diaries of their conversations with site managers and supervisors, so be aware of that possibility when you are approached by unions.  We should keep our own notes of conversations as they occur.Should we designate one person to handle union relations?  We should have a very small group of people to have such a discussions, perhaps the HR site lead or the construction site manager would be the appropriate liaisons.  That way, we don't have the unions approaching our employees.  We have no obligation to have such conversations, but it is a good idea not to be antagonistic with them.   Better to be polite, let them know that we are mobilizing the project, but that we bid this work as a merit shop project and will not sign a pre-hire agreement.  We should not give them any information about our hiring process or plans.We should tell them that we will be glad to consider their people at the time we are hiring, but that we are not taking applications at this time.  We should inform them about how to apply for positions at the site, which will be at an off-site Human Resources office.  We also are going to use the state employment offices for clerical personnel, but not for other types because we have not had much success in receiving qualified candidates.There is a need for HR to look at the off-site office before the lease is signed.Other issues surround gating at the facility.  How will it be gated?  Who will control entry and exits?  What about the other ways into the site?  How do we prevent persons from using an alternative entrance and then getting into our site to talk with our people?  Parking area will be on the other side of the plant.  There are roads between the parking gate and the building site.  Because of all these issues, we should look at a plat for the site and then look at the gating situation.Back to Mark's suggestions:Be careful of calls coming into the project.  Make sure that the receptionist or office manager knows what to say to callers.  Those calls should be directed to that site HR lead.  Also, should inform those people how to answer questions about hiring plans.  E.g., "Are you hiring electricians out there?"  Those should be referred to HR's off site office.  Also, those people should know how to answer questions as to whether we hire union employees.  They should refer such questions to HR and not answer them.  We will have a script for the receptionist for such inquiries.Be sure to follow the 30-day rule.  Also, follow our hiring practices consistently.Ultimately, there will be training for others at the site after more employees are on site, perhaps the last week of October, on union avoidance and other issues.One more follow up item is to make sure that our subcontracts have union harmony provisions.  Galen (Millie?) is going to send those to David Lund.David Lund, Michelle Cash, and Mark Stubley will discuss the issue of which local counsel to get lined up in the event that we need someone locally.

It also raises an issue that we could face if we are not careful.  The article discusses internal diversity studies, which the plaintiffs are using as evidence to support their claims.  The company claims that the studies were done by people who did not know how to conduct the appropriate analyses under the relevant legal standards.   I have this concern here, as well, when we have people running analyses that do not factor in the legal standards and instead try to interpret data themselves.

It looks like the best course of action is to destroy all of the identified materials.  Mere possession of these materials is a violation of law.  Our outside counsel called the FBI, which said that if the company does not know who put the materials out there, it does not have  a duty to report it.We also received advice that the Puerto Rico office of the FBI might be able to assist in narrowing down the possible users to determine who actually was involved.  Our outside counsel suggested that we might want to call the local FBI office and talk with a duty agent.  The number is 787-754-6000.  Given the situation of the possible sale, however, we may choose not to take that route.In any event, if we don't report it, all illegal materials must be destroyed and removed from our systems as soon as possible.Michelle

He certainly has a strong academic and work history.Unfortunately, it is not Enron's practice to hire attorneys right out of law school.  We prefer that our candidates have at least 4-6 years (minimum) experience at a big law firm or substantial corporate law department before they are eligible for consideration here.  The rationale is that we have so much to do that we really cannot provide adequate training, which is critical for new lawyers; nor can we take the time necessary to supervise and review work of lawyers who don't have the requisite experience.So, please thank your friend for his interest.  If you would like, I would be happy to visit with him about other types of opportunities in the legal profession, from law firms to some corporate legal departments that do hire straight out of law school.  Alternatively, he may be a candidate for the Associate and Analyst Program, if he doesn't want to practice law.Call me with any questions.Michelle

I simply don't organize my documents that way.  Instead, I do a numeric list of documents, and the documents are identified by employee name, as opposed to business unit.

So, I can't easily pull out corporate agreements.I can say that most of the corporate agreements I have done have been for RAC or Finance, so Sheila Walton probably has kept track of them somehow.

But, if CRDC defaulted then Chris Cline, Tim Elliott,John Dickinson, and Enron could be responsible for the remaining payments.He believes that if CRDC defaults and the other defendants do not agreeamong themselves as to the amount and manner in which Clonch will be paid,then Clonch will be required to institute one arbitration action againsteach of the remaining defendants.  Additionally, he believes that under theagreement the parties did not agree to joint and several liability.  I askedhim as to why he allowed his clients to be potentially personally liable onthe payments owing to Clonch by CRDC.  He explained that it was a "nobrainer."  He reasoned that Elliott, Cline, and Dickinson are the chiefofficers of CRDC and they will do everything in their power to prevent CRDCfrom defaulting, because they do not want to be subject to personalliability.  Rick also told me that Kevin also agrees with thisinterpretation.	After speaking with Rick Brown, I spoke to Rich Walters, whoinformed me that Clonch refused to accept Enron's offer to guaranteepayments under the settlement agreement beginning 2002 until 2007 at amaximum of $1000 a month and $12,000 a year.Rich Walters told me Karen Miller's interpretation of the handwrittensettlement agreement.  Her interpretation is in accord with Rick Brown'sinterpretation.  For these reasons, only intends to sue Enron and not Cline,Elliott, and Dickinson for violation of the settlement agreement.

Affirmative Action Plan development is supported by specific software that was implemented in January 2000.  ?	The Plans consist of two primary elements, the narrative portion and the statistical portion. ?	Narrative was reviewed for legal merit in January 2000 by George Chaffee, Attorney at Law, Littler Mendelson, Walnut Creek, CA and by a local consultant, George Pharis, President, Strategic Direction Resources Inc. o	Recommended changes were incorporated into the FY 2000 AAPs.  The narrative section of an AAP is generally the same each year with few changes necessary.?	The statistical portion requires an intense amount of labor each year.  The database of the plan has to be confirmed for accuracy?	Plans are reviewed against the previous year's AAP for continuity?	Once we have drafts of the AAP (narrative and statistical portion) for a business unit:o	Draft plan and a memo are sent to the business unit HR head for reviewo	HR head requests any changes and confirms their buy-in before the plan is finalized and distributed to their organizationo	Execution signatures are obtainedo	Plans are distributed to management level employees to guide their hiring/promotion and termination decisions throughout the course of the plan year.o	Quarterly utilization reports are completed and sent to the business units to allow them to track their progress achieving AAP goalso	If a "new goal" is warranted from quarterly reports, it is highlighted for the business unit to consider as they move forward through the rest of the yearRecommendations:?	02 Plan narratives drafted and reviewed by appropriate legal counsel.  (Complete no later than Y/E 2001)	o	OFCCP changes to regulations became effective December 13, 2000.  New Regs have reduced some narrative               requirements however underlying responsibilities are still implied  ?	AAP Plan drafts provided to HR Head and respective legal counsel for review, change, and approvals before being submitted for execution signatures?	OLER to revise and communicate new execution milepost to get AAPs completed. Earliest data access date is Jan 15 - (reflecting Y/E promotions, terms etc)  OLER is committed to supporting an effective AAP process for client units.  Please assist us by sharing you interests and perspectives on the recommendations offered.   Regards, Rj.    file: oler-core060101***

It occurred to me that we often are successful in resolving these thingsquickly and cheaply by having someone at Enron call a contact at the newcompany, TXU, and bring the issue to a head. So far as I know no one hasmade such a call in this case.  I recall from the Union litigation a fewyears ago there was an Enron exec who went to TUFCO by the name of MarkMcNally. We deposed Mark in that case and he was very professional andcooperative. McNally had been at Enron and (I believe) Houston Pipeline for15-17 years. He's now been with TXU 4 or 5 years and is CFO. A call to himmight get this off dead center. I'm copying Mark on this email because Iknow Mark knows McNally well.	What do you think?	Best regards,	Bill

If not, I don't think that he could contact his friends who used to be at Novarco simply because they were acquired.

We are getting through it.Cameron actually wore his yellow rain slicker, his yellow rain shoes, and his red fireman's hat.  So, instead of rain boy, he was a fireman.  I must admit that he looked absolutely adorable!!Your bash sounds like it was a lot of fun.  I wish I could get Trey to dress up, but he really isn't into that type of thing.  We went to the opera Sat. night -- Tanenhouser.  Wagner really is uptight, isn't he?  Still, I enjoyed it quite a bit -- escaped into the music.  I went to a gala last week for MD Anderson Cancer Center.  It was amazing.  Joan Lunden MC'd.  The Houston Symphony provided music.  Video from George W. Bush.  Speech by GHW Bush.  Entertainment by one of the Irish Tenors, Lyle Lovett, Dhianne Carroll (who had a costume change even though she sang only for 20 minutes!), a 300-person chior, all accompanied by the Houston Symphony.  It was quite the event.  Persons there included the former President Bush and Barbara, James Baker, Alan Simpson, lots of local celebs, and me and my brother  (one of these things is not like the other!).  Still, we had a great time.  So, not all gloom and doom around here.Well, I'd better get back to it.Michelle

He seeks damages of $1 million.Jim Derrick passed this lawsuit to me, but let me know if you want me to manage it on behalf of EES.  I have contacted Chicago counsel (for information, not retention, purposes) to determine the answer date, which is 30 days.  I do not believe that we have been properly served, however, so we appear to have additional time.  The suit was filed 11/1, and we received it sometime last week, via cover letter to Ken Lay from Lindert (rather bizzarre, if you ask me). The law firm representing the plaintiff is not some hack plaintiff's firm; it actually is a blue chip family law firm with a good reputation in Cook County.The case probably should be removed to federal court due to diversity of citizenship.  According to the Seyfarth, Shaw lawyers I contacted on Friday, the Circuit Court of Cook County, Law Division is not a place where we would want to be, and federal court is preferable.  We have 30 days to remove to federal court.Let me know how you want me to proceed.Michelle

Our practice and intent has been to pay after they start, and I believe that the letter refers to payment after they start, so there is some wiggle room on the other side.I agree that it is not a "slam dunk" on our part, but my view is that the risk is worth not doing anything unless and until we get some sort of demand or claim.  We then can cross the bridge as to how to proceed.  In the meantime, I am comfortable with this level of risk.Of course, if these folks are ones to whom we are paying any money, then the waiver should address the signing bonus issue.Ya'll let me know if you disagree.

Instead, HR, with assistance from legal, has put forth a matrix for businesses to use in determining which employees, if any, will be affected.  Listed on that matrix include factors such as job criticality (which is weighted to be twice as significant as any of the other factors), ability to perform several different types of jobs, business knowledge, leadership, teamwork, and historical performance over the last 18 months.  PRC results would not be the sole factor.  Otherwise, someone who is the only person who knows how to do a mission-critical job might be affected simply because he rated out lower at mid-year review.  That result obviously would be disasterous.Michelle

For simplicity, I would use the ethnic codes we have in datamart/sap rather than creating new ones. That makes it easier to populate.  One other field to add would be visa status.   As with the other documents, I believe that the population of these documents can be done now, with just the blank for "yes" or "no" for layoff waiting for the rest of the process.  You probably will have to run these by the generalist, Valeria or someone in ER team, and the attorneys for the special risk factors column. Be sure and mark this document as privileged and confidential, prepared at the direction of counsel, so that we can protect the privilege of this document if necessary. Thanks. Michelle

She indicated that they would like for there to be a protocol for how to handle things if there is a desire to allow the hiring of employees from Dynegy to Enron or vice versa.  Of course, such hiring would have to be coordinated at the top of the company to avoid any type of free-for-all.  At a minimum, I would think that you and Andrea Lang would have to be the ones who make the decisions.  With that thought, I have asked Tim O'Rourke's team to work on such a protocol.In the meantime, Kristen mentioned that one person in Rick Shapiro's group wants to go to Dynegy.  She understood that Shapiro had said it was ok.  Do you know about that?  If not, should you give Andrea a call about it?

I also probably need to ask the comp committee about these "tolerable" conflicts of interest, particularly in light of recent press coverage of Enron.  We'll discuss that this afternoon, Nancy, but I am not feeling like we should agree to any of those types of provisions.  Yikes!

david.oxley@enron.com,david.oxley@enron.com,david.oxley@enron.com,Subject: Privileged and Confidential -- Performance Bonus Language,David,You asked me to provide my opinion about the employment agreement provisions relating to target bonus amounts that are based on performance.  The bonus language contained in the majority of the agreements with a target bonus is as follows:	"Provided that Enron meets its earnings targets and provided that Employee is rated within the top 25% of the performance criteria under Enron's annual performance rating system or its equivalent for the calendar year in question, Employee's annual bonus amounts under the Plan for calendar years 2001, 2002, and 2003 (payable in 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively), shall be based on an annual bonus target of $_____________."This language does not address a person's performance as compared to one's peers, but instead looks at the number of performance criteria and requires that a person be in the top 25% of those criteria.  Thus, if there are only 3 rating categories (i.e., 1, 2, 3, distributed as 10-80-10), then only the people in the top category would be within the top 25/33% of the rating criteria.  Given the huge change in our process, however, there is an argument that the above language cannot be applied to the current scheme and that instead, we should look at the top 25% of the peer group, instead of performance criteria, even though that was not the intent of the provision when it was drafted.As a result, I would suggest that the middle category be divided further into either 2 or 3 subcategories (i.e., 2A, 2B, or 2C).  That way, persons who fall out in categories 1 or 2A would be eligible for the target bonus.  If there is a decision not to break  down the middle 80 further, then it would be useful to look at those employees with a bonus target that we think is too high. For those employees, a more conservative approach may be to evaluate them on a scale that is more subdivided than the 10-80-10 breakdown and to document that they fell out in the bottom 75% of the categories under that process.  Of course, it goes without saying that we should ensure consistent treatment based on race, sex, national origin, age, etc. in this process.Please let me know if you have any questions.
