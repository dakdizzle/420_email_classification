jsmith@austintx.com,jsmith@austintx.com,jsmith@austintx.com,Subject: RE: The Stage,Jeff,I don't understand what you want me to do with this letter.  Regarding the utilities,  you and I know that I have had the right to shut off the utilities to a property I don't own for sometime now.  I did not do that because I wanted to stay on good terms with the Kuo's while negotiating the release.  I had the utilities taken out of my name yesterday.  The city of seguin informs me that the meters were read yesterday and the final bill will be mailed to me next week.  Then I can compute the amount that the Kuo's owe me for utilities and send them a check for the rock repairs.  Please let Pauline know that she needs to go down to the city and take care of the deposit by Friday or the power may be disconnected.  The utilities are already in her name.In my mind the utilities were never a bargaining chip.  Rather, you and I are paying the $11,000 in exchange for the release.  Regarding the transfer of ownership into a limited partnership, I will most likely be agreeable to this but I want to review all the loan documents with Jacques and ensure that there is still a personal guarantee on the two notes.  I expect to have that done by Friday.I would like for her to sign the release today, but if she won't sign until I consent to the limited partnership then the release will have to wait until Friday.  As far as the utilities go,  I made the transfer for two reasons: 1) I need to know the amount that I have paid to net against the $11,000 and 2) I had the right to take the utilities out of my name and I didn't want the balance to get out of hand.I will call you when I am comfortable consenting to the limited partnership.Phillip

melick@texas1031.com,melick@texas1031.com,melick@texas1031.com,Subject: Texas1031_homepage,Carlos,Can you help me with several 1031 exchange questions?  I spoke to your office and they thought it best that I address my questions to you directly.  Here is my situation.  I purchased a 32 acre tract in Leander about 8 months ago.  I have a contract to sell the property which should close around July 18th.  I expect to realize a gain of around $400,000.  See calculations below:Sales price:		2,100,000Purchase price		1,200,000Fees&Devel costs	  500,000Profit			 400,000The cash generated at the sale will be close to $1 million after repayment of a loan.I am interested in protecting this gain through a 1031 exchange.I am already involved in a couple of other real estate transactions that might qualify.  First, there is a 10 acre tract that was purchased by Bishops Corner, Ltd for $1.15 million six months ago.  I lent the partnership the cash to buy the land with the intent of working with the developer to build a multifamily project.  We could not come to terms for the development, so the partnership was conveyed to me.  The loan still exist.  I am an 80% limited partner.  Another investor is the other limited partner.  We have set up a Corporation to be the general partner.  We intend to develop the property. Is there a creative way to use the land purchase in a 1031 exchange?Second,  I have a small tract in New Braunfels under contract for $400,000.  I am applying for FHA financing for a 180 unit apartment complex and hope to receive an invitation letter prior to closing.  I would need to place this property in a limited partnership eventually, but is there a way to buy the property hold it in my name long enough to satisfy the IRS then move it to a LP.If neither of these deals qualify, I would still like to find another piece of property.  My two biggest concerns are tying up too much cash and holding property in my own name.  Is there a way to insure during the 1st year then move a different entity?Thank you in advance for your help.Phillip Allen	8855 Merlin CtHouston, TX 77055pallen70@hotmail.comwk 713-853-7041hm 713-463-8626

john.lavorato@enron.com,john.lavorato@enron.com,john.lavorato@enron.com,Subject: ,John,Two items:1.  I spoke to John McKay about Sumas.  His views seem well thought out.  He is short the summer due to the prospect of another 200,000+/day of supply coming back by July 1st.  See attached spreadsheet.  In order to displace Aeco gas coming down to Kingsgate his target for Sumas value is AECO -0.10.  But since his forecast for Aeco is that they will have 30 BCF left in storage at the end of March and current cash is trading down 0.70 or wider versus a rest of summer curve around down 0.50, he is expecting the AECO curve to widen to down 0.85.  Therefore, his ultimate target for Sumas is down 0.95 versus the current market of down 0.40	His winter Sumas shorts are based on his analysis of total supply capacity versus peak demand. See attached spreadsheet.  Sumas still commands the premium of an isolated market during the winter but the supply numbers don't  support that premium.	In conclusion, I think I will sell some more summer sumas for my book. 2.  I will stay after the meeting to talk about Mike G's issues.

jeff.dasovich@enron.com,jeff.dasovich@enron.com,jeff.dasovich@enron.com,Subject: RE: Call to Discuss Possible Options to Mitigate Effect of DWR,jeff,Is the problem that the energy DWR purchased is above market and not needed by CORE  or  just above market.  If the energy is needed by CORE wouldn't the deals just be blended in as costs like utility gen and QF supply?  If the energy is not needed now could the state sell back the excess then compute the exact loss and put a surcharge on rates for all or some customers that recoup that amount over time.  Once again there would be a CTC type recovery period but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered.  Phillip

gthorse@keyad.com,gthorse@keyad.com,gthorse@keyad.com,Subject: ,Greg,I noticed in the san macos record that some zoning changes were underway.  =First, I wanted to make sure our property would not be affected.  Second, p=art of the land that is being rezoned is targeted for "seniors".  I would l=ike to explore the possibility of developing a seniors project ( not assist=ed living). Maybe we could look at the property mentioned below.   As I hav=e mentioned,  my goal is to invest around $2 million in real estate over th=e next two years.  At the current rate that amount would cover the equity r=equirements for 4 projects assuming I continued to have minority interest p=artner like Keith.Here is the article:Sector 2 plan geets boost from council  By MURLIN EVANS - Staff Reporter  H=ome and landowners in northwestern San Marcos will soon have a revised futu=re land use plan to consult for development in the area.  The San Marcos Ci=ty Council on first reading unanimously approved changes to its Sector Two =Land Use Plan -- changes over a year in the making and covering a 1.26 squa=re mile area -- intended to encourage development that is both acceptable a=nd appropriate for the region.  Significant to the revisions are those affe=cting a controversial tract owned by resident Jack Weatherford at the corne=r of Ranch Road 12 and the newly named Craddock Avenue (Bishop Street).  We=atherford filed suit against the city earlier this year as a result of vari=ous city commissions declining to approve re-zoning plans the landowner say=s were in synch with land uses deemed acceptable in the current Sector Two =plan.  Proposed changes to Weatherford's 54 acre tract -- which have no dir=ect effect on existing zoning -- deletes the 10 acres of high density resid=ential allowed in the current plan and adds instead two additional acres of= commercial, one additional acre of medium density residential, and seven a=dditional acres of low density residential.  In addition, the total eight a=cres of the Weatherford tract proposed for medium density residential is su=ggested limited to town home, single-family, or multi-family senior housing= development in the revised future land use plan.  The total 10 acres of co=mmercial allowed on the property is proposed limited to "community commerci=al" -- a yet to be established zoning district -- loosely defined as to ens=ure more compatibility with existing residential neighborhoods complete wit=h buffering and landscaping.  A 50 foot greenbelt buffer is also proposed t=o separate the commercial areas from residential ones in the revised plan. = However, a curb cut envisioned to access this property from RR 12 drew som=e concern from council members over the potential traffic hazards it may po=se on the busy state highway.  Proposed are two curb cuts, one accessing th=e proposed Weatherford commercial area from RR 12 and one from Craddock Ave=nue.  While the state highway department and city would have input into the= plans for where the eventual curb cut would go, city planning director Ron= Patterson said the allowance of the two curb cuts was a compromise between= the wishes of area landowners and Weatherford.  Council member Jane Hughso=n supported the idea of removing the RR 12 curb cut allowance from the Sect=or Plan, but evaluating a developer's plans for possibly locating one in th=e area as development proceeds.  "I'd rather say "no' and if someone comes =us with a really good idea, look at it then," Hughson said.  Councilman Ed =Mihalkanin expressed similar safety concerns over the final placement of th=e curb cut.  "It seems to me we're asking for a bunch of accidents to happe=n there," Mihalkanin said.  A motion by Hughson to amend the plan to exclud=e curb cuts from RR 12 into the property failed on a 3-3 tie vote with San =Marcos Mayor David Chiu and council members Joe Cox and Paul Mayhew voting =against the move. Council member Martha Castex Tatum was not present at the= meeting.  Curb cuts or not, the Sector Two Plan earned support from severa=l residents and neighborhood representatives, who said the plan was a good =compromise.  Oak Heights resident John McBride, who has been an active crit=ic and participant in the Sector Two revision process, especially concernin=g the Weatherford tract, said the revised plan better served the interests =of the city as a whole.  "This is not a victory for one side or the other,"= said McBride, alluding to a fallout between neighborhood groups opposed to= Weatherford's initial plans for his property, "but a victory for the City =of San Marcos.

Yes, it's true, suggest SG Cowen media analysts Ed Hatch, Peter Mirsky and Eric Handler, in this week's Media Money Manager. Automobile advertising is the largest category in domestic consumer media spending and accounts for about 17%, or $15 billion, the stock studiers say, using data from Competitive Media Reporting. By early fall, the analysts expect the car companies "to ramp spending back up to support new model introductions and to regain market share from the imports." Such an event, says the SG Cowen crew, could mark a significant catalyst for companies that depend heavily on TV advertising, like AOL Time Warner (AOL), Viacom (VIA, VIAB), News Corp. (NWS), and Disney (DIS). ( BS)

david.oxley@enron.com,david.oxley@enron.com,david.oxley@enron.com,Subject: RE: Answer,David,For clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mean Section 6.3.  Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan.  The beginning of Section 6.3 states "Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your translation of "a single sum distribution" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.  Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value.  This is the methodology described in Section 7.1.Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns.  Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further.Phillip

I would limit the introduction to types of risk, identifying risk, and examples when risks are not hedged.  Then the second section should contain all the details of hedging tools.  Definitions of derivatives and how they can be used to manage the risk in the first section would be in this section.  The third section would include the roles and accounting basics.

richard.morgan@austinenergy.com,richard.morgan@austinenergy.com,richard.morgan@austinenergy.com,Subject: ,Richard,I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with SIP's.  I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can decide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprints completed.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with 8.5" roof panels and use a metal roof.I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that is also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.  That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional costs for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?   Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help me construct the best home for the money.  I am trying to get a bid from Wink with Premier based on you reference.Thank you for your help.Phillip Allenpallen@enron.com713-853-7041

gthorse@keyad.com,gthorse@keyad.com,gthorse@keyad.com,Subject: , Greg,I plugged the data on Colonial Oaks into your format.  The actual NOI for 2001 is around 305,000.  But there is not a professional management company.  Subtracting $25,000 for management costs the NOI would be $280,000.  However, I increased the taxes and a few other expenses to bring total expenses up to $3,000/unit.  This would yield an NOI of $240,000.  Comparing the rents charged to the other 17 properties, it doesn't look like the rents have a great deal of upside.  The asking price is $2,700,000.  Using $240,000 would make this an 8.9 cap.  Using the seller's NOI of $280,000 would be a 10.4 cap.  The cost per unit is $33,750 for a 1969 project.  The cost per square foot is 36.58.  The numbers would be better if the property was offered at $2.5 million.  Jeff Smith claims that $2.7 million is as low as the seller will go.  This property has not been on the market.  So I would like your input of what the market would pay for it.  If $280,000 is a reasonable NOI, then I would thing it would be sold fairly quickly for $2.7 million.  It does have the benefit of all brick exterior and elderly tenants.  Plus the location is by far the most convenient.Financing is the other consideration.  I am assuming 25 year, 7%,  and 25% down.  What do you think could actually be achieved?  Can you put me in contact with a lender?I will follow up with a phone call.Thanks,Phillip
jsmith@austintx.com,jsmith@austintx.com,jsmith@austintx.com,Subject: ,Jeff,I reviewed your revised offer sheet.  I am OK with the effective income of $484K.  Her records show basically no other income ($75/month), so I subtracted $3,000 from your number.  The expenses just need to reflect $20,000 more property taxes and the numbers should be right on.  $484 less $244 would be $240 of NOI.  I spoke to Jim Murnane this afternoon.  He feels this property would most likely warrant 7.5% and a 30 year amortization.  See the attached spreadsheets.

richard.morgan@austinenergy.com,richard.morgan@austinenergy.com,richard.morgan@austinenergy.com,Subject: RE:,Richard,I checked with Wink and his prices were slightly lower per square foot but the builder was not keen on the panels Wink is selling because the dimensional lumber to frame windows and doors is not included.  So that reduces some of the savings.  Either way it still appears that a panel home will cost close to $20,000 more for a 4000 sq ft home.  Even if I assume my energy savings will be $125/month, it would take approximately 22 years to recover the upfront cost assuming a 5% interest rate.  Cost is a major concern, but I am also concerned with the comfort level of the upstairs.  I am under the impression that the panels will prevent the upstairs from feeling significantly hotter than the downstairs as most two story homes do.  What are some other alternatives that would also be effective?  Radiant barrier?  More attic ventilation?  Thank you for your help.Phillip Allen713-853-7041

This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=ceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as= of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%= of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=res in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=f Enron Corp. common stock.There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=  section 6.3 begins with "notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.="  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=t apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating "a single sum distrib=ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts" indicates that one pay=ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states "The val=ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock".=  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every= share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=ction 6.3.The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of= distribution under each of the three interpretations:Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1Number of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=esRelative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13Phantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,65810% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866Value to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792Current stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10Distribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 sharesI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is =a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. = =20In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the= same issue.

Since I have spent so much time researching the house, I think my numbers are pretty close.  I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis.  I don't know if this would be agreeable to you.  Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think.  If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections.  I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors.We are torn between two good locations.  However, we are leaning towards Kerrville.  The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially.  We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to  our plan to move to San Marcos.  I don't know how many jobs you have going currently, but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately.Phillip Allen713-463-8626pallen70@hotmail.com

Any possibility for a= deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republic=ans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic cauc=us is reportedly "unwilling to fight" for Davis.  Many legislative Republic=ans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, o=nce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would "double= dip" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg=islature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses th=e details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac=e.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon=g-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t=hat the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in =breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th=e bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st wi=ll be very difficult.The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat=e would "eat" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General= Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately =$8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this =concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful=l disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the =details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they= will support the bond issuance to go forward.Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB =31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bi=ll passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac=k of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo=r community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be am=ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, curre=ntly in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get =paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li=kely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).=20=20According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republic=ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in =the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 =of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republ=icans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend= to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers repo=rtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind=ications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.=20Key Points of the Bridge FinancingInitial Loan Amount:=09$4.125 BLenders:=09=09JP Morgan=09=09$2.5 B=09=09=09Lehman Brothers=09=09$1.0 B=09=09=09Bear Stearns=09=09$625 MTax Exempt Portion:=09Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exemptProjected Interest Rate:=09Taxable Rate=09=095.77%=09=09=09Tax-Exempt Rate=09=094.77%Current Projected=20Blended IR:=09=095.38%Maturity Date:=09=09August 29, 2001For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This TimeThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create t=he California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion= authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut=horized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi=tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power =going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz=ations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor =has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is =that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No f=urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it =is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas=ing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the Calif=ornia Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be consi=dered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl=ier in the crisis.=20SoCal Edison and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  T=he first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the =governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au=gust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According t=o sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s=igned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi=s and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicat=es that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank=ruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. =20The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is=suance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s=tating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th=en the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the st=ate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and p=assed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for= bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and= the DWR proportionately from rate payments.

Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.

He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some additional insight?Thank you,Phillip

The following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email with comments.Phillip Allen

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:Price caps are almost never the right answerPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagesCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptableEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the WestThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.

johnniebrown@juno.com,johnniebrown@juno.com,johnniebrown@juno.com,Subject: ,Johnnie,Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in cost over stick built.Please email your cost estimates when complete.Thank you,Phillip Allen

jsmith@austintx.com,jsmith@austintx.com,jsmith@austintx.com,Subject: ,Jeff,I received the fax from Velasquez Masonry for $11,000.  He is proposing to do work on nine buildings.  From the memo from the city it sounds like 33,34,35, and 42 are the units that are at risk for collapse.  I don't want to pay for any discretionary work.  Also, I am still waiting for a quote from another mason.  I am willing to offer $5,000 toward the repair and removal of rock in return for the release prepared by Jacques.  With regard to the utilities I want to have them transferred on Monday the 21st.  That will be one month that the utilities have been in my name.  It needs to be clear that I will net that month's electric and water against the $5,000 for the rock.If she is willing to take the money for repairs we should be able to wrap things up immediately.  If not we will have to continue negotiations, but the utilities still need to be transferred.Phillip

adrianne.engler@enron.com,adrianne.engler@enron.com,adrianne.engler@enron.com,Subject: ,Adrianne,Last night I spoke to two potential candidates for the trading track, Emil Carlsson and Thomas Considine.Emil is currently tutoring at Hofstra after leaving an option trading position.  I would recommend bringing Emil to Houston for further interviews based on his technical knowledge.  The biggest drawback was his current situation might show a lack of motivation.Thomas was working as an equity market maker.  He is interested in making a change to a job where he can develop more expertise.  He is seeking to develop a better understanding of the market he trades.  The trading track would be an excellent match for his desires.  I would also recommend bringing Thomas to Houston for further consideration.Phillip
john.lavorato@enron.com,john.lavorato@enron.com,john.lavorato@enron.com,Subject: ,John,Managing VAR limits is essential and P&L Penalties are a great way to achieve this.  However, we need to find a way to impliment this method while minimizing negative side effects such as: (1) discouraging aggressive trading; and (2) significant morale reductions caused by penalties which do not fit the crime.I still disagree with the $1 Million fine for such a minor violation of our VAR limit.  The punishment does not fit the crime. What message are you trying to send?  The message being received is that we should trade less aggressively and leave several million dollars of headroom at all times.  Also locations such as Socal, Malin and PG&E should be avoided due to limited liquidity and potential volatility spikes.  I know these are not your intended messages.  I realize you have given the west desk significant leeway in the last few months regarding VAR.  We have been making excellent progress towards VAR reduction in an environment in which the VAR calculation and tolerance are constantly changing.   My suggestion for implementing a VAR control system that provides for penalties but gives traders room to probe for maximum VAR utilization is a warning for minor breaches (<$500,000) and penalties for violation of two or more consecutive days or initial violations greater than $500,000.  The amount of the penalties should be documented in advance and should increase with the amount of the violation.Please consider these suggestions.  We want to play by the rules, but the rules need to be fair and known in advance.  Also, we are willing to accept these policy revisions retroactively and forget about the $1 million from this morning.Phillip

You might mention to them that we need to get the utilities settled up before we pay the $11,000.  It might be a good idea to go ahead and have the utilities transferred so we can get the final amount since 4/20.Also May 20th was supposed to be the 1st payment on the two notes.
