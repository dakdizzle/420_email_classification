Charles\Weldon, V. Charles\Sent ItemsX-Origin: WELDON-VX-FileName: Weldon, V. Charles.pstAs I previously shared, the result for vandium in the low-sulfer diesel (#2 fuel oil) came back at <0.1 ppm versus the "spec" of <0.05 ppm.  I just talked to the lab supervisor at Saybolt whom performed the analysis; and according to him there is no practical way of measuring the vanadium content more precisely than within one-tenth of a ppm.  The only way he knows of is to use a NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) machine that NASA uses to analyze rocket fuel.  He is not sure whether or not the government would allow use of such a machine but estimates that, if they did allow, it could cost upwards of $10,000. Please let me know if we should pursue this matter any further.Thanks,Charlie

Charles\Weldon, V. Charles\Sent ItemsX-Origin: WELDON-VX-FileName: Weldon, V. Charles.pstTeam,We now have the capability of importing live EOL quotes into our models if so desired.  Colin Tonks, who supports IT development efforts for the trading floor, has made this capability available to us via a file that I have now saved in the Models directory under the name "EOL_Product_Listen".In order to run the file, you will first need to run a program called "Tibco Rendezvous Client"  You can run this program by going to the Start Menu/System Utility Applications/Installation and Disk Creation/"Install Tibco Rendezvous Client".  You will have to reboot after installation is complete.  After rebooting you can then open the program "EOL Program Listen".The program has 2 sheets: 1) EOL, and 2) EOL_SearchSheet 1 (EOL) is the sheet that pulls in the live quotes based on an EOL ID number that you enter in column C. In order to determine the correct EOL ID number, you need to use Sheet 2 (EOL_Search).  On this sheet, you can enter a search string in cell B1 and then hit the search macro.  Efficient use of this search macro requires some trial and error since the search is limited to a max number.  Once you find your product ID #, you can enter it into Sheet 1 (EOL) and then hit the "Start" button.  You will then be pulling in live quotes which can be linked to any model which you wish.A word of caution:  We will likely all find limitations into how this tool can be effectively used.  For instance, it has been brought to my attention that the product ID #'s change each month as new prompt months roll on.  Thus, the tool should be used with discretion and verification that the right ID # is linking up should always be verified, especially on older files.  Nonetheless, as we get comfortable with the tool, I believe that it will provide some value on deals that require real-time pricing inputs.Please let me know if you have any questions/comments.  I can provide a quick demo at my desk if anyone wishes.Thanks,Charlie

Trucks need pumps.2) What size lines are the trucks pumping into? 3"?     3"3) When connecting to our lines do the trucks need anything other than standard fittings?    Standard or 3 inch disconnectsOutstanding issues:1) Full spec sheet--especially sodium and potassium guarantees    The environmental specs are known but the specs on the turbine itself from Mitsubishi (MHI) are not known.  We cannot determine the final specs unitl the MHI requirements are known.2) After the initial tank fill delivery availability 24 hours/day and weekends?  Always someone at plant. Can take delivery 24/7.3) Tank fill and beyond--why not the full 1MM gallons?  Need 200K gallons to replace previously burned oil only.4) Dyed/non dyed fuel issue--tax evaluating   Dyed5) Identify previous diesel supplier to the plant   Coastal was previous supplier6) Design a fuel resupply plan including prepurchase of fuel, call on transportation, buy diesel calls for expected outage periods7) Buyer of record and credit issues with suppliers   FPUA is buyer of record8) Tank fill price--fixed or floating? (Platt's, NYMEX, OPIS, rack price)  9) Commercial start date of plan     Tank to be ready on 5/15/200110) Any other issue to be discussed

Pierce Gas Capacity AssumptionsThe following basic assumptions concerning gas capacity requirements for the Fort Pierce project were confirmed today at a meeting attended by Dave Fairley, Ed McMichael, Ruth Concannon, Mark Breese, Eric Boyt, and Charlie Weldon.   (NOTE:  The heat rates and MW are subject to change pending final engineering evaluation.  The intent of this note is to document the overall runtime assumptions.)1) During the summertime months of May through September, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where  Enron's 200 MW are dispatched as are Ft. Pierce's 82MW.2)  Enron will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 200 MW for 16 hours per day at our "bought-down" heat rate of 6690.  This equals 22,300 MMBTU/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in only a 16 hour period (6% per hour)  The table below summarizes the monthly capacity requirements:   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity 	Capacity From East Desk	May	22,300	0	22,300	0	June	22,300	0	22,300	0	July	22,300	0	22,300	0	August	22,300	0	22,300	0	September	22,300	0	22,300	0	  NTOE:  Prior to Phase VI completion, the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.3)  Ft. Pierce will use its existing FT via FGU to secure its gas requirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is dispatched in the summer.4)  For the winter months of October through April, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where Ft. Pierce is not dispatched, thus leaving Enron with 282MW at the overall plant heat rate of 7500.  This equates to 35,251 MMBTU/day and allows for taking the full capacity in only 16 hours (6% per hour)5)  Because Ft. Pierce will not be dispatched during the winter, their unused capacity via FGU will be available for Enron.  These amounts differ by month as summarized in the table below.6) Enron will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 282 MW for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate, less the monthly capacities available from Ft. Pierce via FGU.  These non-FGU purchased quantities will come from the Phase VI capacity and the East Desk as shown below:	   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity (Nov-Mar = 28% of Summer)	Capacity From East Desk	October	35,251	14,665	22,300	0	November	35,251	14,595	6,244	14,412	December	35,251	14,895	6,244	14,112	January	35,251	16,547	6,244	12,460	February	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690	March	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690	April	35,251	15,317	22,300	0	NOTE:  Prior to Phase VI completion , the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.7)  Backup documentation supporting the hourly gas requirement in each dispatch mode is attached to this memo.

Poise / Confidence    	         1	No problem here.  Suzette is quite confident without being cocky.	Leadership Potential   	         1	 It is very easy to imagine Suzette in a leadership role.	Personality / Enthusiasm    	         1	Very energetic and ascited about the possibility of being   a Texas MBA student.	Maturity    	         2	She should not have any problem mixing with older, more-experienced students.	Clarity of Professional Focus    	         2	Seems very focused on the potential opportunities following receiving an MBA degree, but is still open-minded. 	Please provide the Admission Committee with a brief narrative overview of your AdmissionVisit dialogue. You may use this opportunity to elaborate further on the above rankings. We had a very comfortable and open exchange of information regarding her work experience and views on current business topics.  She is well-seasoned in dealing with complex business issues and would very likely be ahead of many of her fellow students.  She exudes confidence yet remains open to new ideas and ways of thinking.  I have no reservation in saying that Suzette would flourish at UT and contribute significantly to the overall quality of the class.Do you believe this candidate is a good match for the culture and strengths of the TEXASMBA program? Please elaborate on any reservations you may have. Suzette is definitely a good match for the Texas MBA program.  She is a high energy, very results-oriented individual with a tremendous track record of successful accomplishments.  Her personality is very conducive to working in a diverse team environment and I see no issue that would prevent her from being a top-notch MBA student at UT.

This is unfortunate, and it's about tochange.  If you notice, despite the fact that GOPUSA.com has notpromoted the board at all, it has received a number of posting over thelast several months.Now, in our effort to really build a GOPUSA community, we are completelyredesigning the message board!  The new message board is called theGOPUSA.com Forum.  It uses much better software than we had before, andit is much more versatile:* Users will actually register and be assigned a password.  Thispassword will be sent to them so that e-mail addresses can't be bogus.The users e-mail address, however, does not have to appear on his/herposts.* There is a personal message section on the board in which a registereduser can leave a message for another registered user.* There is an Announcements section where GOPUSA.com can post new newsand information.* There are varying levels of "members" depending on how many posts auser has made.* There are icons incorporated on the board for many symbols.* There is a lot more as well...So, what we need to do is thoroughly test out the board.  My plan is tolaunch it with an announcement in the Monday morning edition of theEagle.  So we need to do as much testing as we can this week.  Then,late Saturday or Sunday, I'll clean out all the test messages, and openit up to you guys to start posting real messages.Here's what I'd like you to do:* Go to the GOPUSA.com Forum athttp://gopusa.com/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.pl* Register with the Forum* You'll get a password which you can easily change to a differentpassword in your "profile"* Make some posts to the existing topics.  These posts don't have to berelated to the topic.  We're simply testing at this point.

Fairly similar to what we priced yesterday, but we only have 2 volume increments.  Also, we need to price this as an annual deal with 1 exercise at the end of each calendar year.  (2010 would be exercised on 12/31/2010).  Also, we need to refresh the fixed price quotes on the last sheet in the attached file as well.  These prices I asked John Griffith about last friday.  Use tonights close if you don't mind.Please let me know if you have any questions,  Thanks again,eric

john.kiani@enron.com,john.kiani@enron.com,john.kiani@enron.com,Subject: ,X-FileName: Weldon, V. Charles.pstJohn,Attached is the estimated notional bid for the 10-year term gas (9/2001-8/2011) delivered per your proposed project with National Fuel.The bid as of Tuesday's closing prices comes to $4.63/MMBTU with the following assumptions:1)  Per Goeff Storey, the basis spread is zero from the mid using the CGPR-Niagara curve.2)  National Fuel will deliver the gas on the NFG system at Niagara.  The desired point per Storey would be on TCPL/Niagara system on the Canadian side of the border and hence a 5 cent discount has been applied for transport.    It is possible that it could be negotiated with NFG to deliver the gas on the TCPL/Niagara system.3) Nymex bid is six cents off the mid for a ten year quote of this (small) size.Let me know if you have any further questions.Thanks,Charlie
