akhan@khanventures.com,akhan@khanventures.com,akhan@khanventures.com,Subject: eBay Auction,Hey I sent this guy a food processor for about $30 that apparently got damaged in the mail. He admittedthat it was packed well, but asked me what "suggestions" I had.  I did not offer him insurance nor did he request it.  So I don't feel I am responsible.  He probably agrees although he is not happy about getting a useless item.  I was going to write him back saying sorry, but I don't feel responsible.  The USPS damaged the product and we did not agree to have it shiupped insured.  Would you suggest something different?

tomf@calpine.com,tomf@calpine.com,tomf@calpine.com,Subject: ,Hey there,Hope everything is going well.  I have some bad news.  In case you have not heard, my Dad passed on a week ago Sunday.  I was in LA for Adnan's wedding when my brother called.  Drove up to SF Sunday night, funeral was Monday afternoon.  I stayed in SF for a couple days, but there wasn't much I needed to do.  My brother is and will be taking care of paperwork and my Dad's apt and stuff like that.  So I drove back down to LA and stayed there for a couple days before returning to Houston.Life at Enron is pretty down these days.  I am very fortunate to still be employed.  As you prob know of the Houston employees were cut loose last Monday.  On Friday they swiped about half of ENA.  It was a bit of a shocker.  I thought layoffs would be minimal around this group.  Origination is almost non existant now.  Some good people I worked with or out.  Since I wasn't here Friday, I was really nervous coming in.  But I think it's ok for now.They are in negotiations with a few banks to buy the floor, or what is left of it.  They'll probably form a new patnership with a new name and everything.  Honestly, I think that is llikely to happen.  It's just a question of what will be left by the time that all happens.I see on my streamer that CPN is down to 18 1/4.  Ouch.  Morgan Stanley downgraded the whole sector, what a bunch of geniuses.  Let's just hope for the best.Ok then drop me a line when you have a chance.  My home address is esaibi@houston.rr.com in case Enron bites the dust.  LaterEric

Half of the= Houston office was laid off early December.  More to come I am sure.  My g=roup was purchased by UBS Warburg.  I am fortunate that they offered me a j=ob.  A bunch of guys in my group were not.  I feel lucky, things could be m=uch worse for me, but instead I have an opportunity to be part of a pretty =impressive organization.  Work has a actually been a little strange, since =the company had declared bankruptcy we litterally have nothing to do.  Sinc=e the first week of Dec, I've been going to work for maybe a couple hours a= day, just hanging out, talking to the other guys, surfin the net.  It give=s me the chance to take care of all the errand type stuff I normally don't =have a chance to.  I've been cooking a lot, taking care of my backyard, sel=lin shit on ebay, stuff like that.  Some of the other traders have been rea=ding trading books and stuff, but you know me...  By the way my permanent h=ome email is now esaibi@houston.rr.com <mailto:esaibi@houston.rr.com>.=20I got your card that you sent to Adnan.  Thanks.  I'm not sure if I told yo=u, but I bought a house here a few months back.  When my Dad was planning t=o move here I thought it would be better to buy a place instead of renting =a big apt.  It's brand new, location is pretty good in that it is near a lo=t of things.  Although the area right around here is a bit sketchy.  I figu=re it'll probably get better over time.  I hope things are going well for y=ou.  When will you visit the U.S?  If you ever visit LA let me know.  I cou=ld always meet you there if you give me enough notice.  As you can imagine,= airline tickets are pretty cheap these days.=20Can you believe Khan is married?  It was kinda strange cuz I was pretty muc=h the only one of his friends involved in the wedding.  His brother and fam=ily were able to show up for the ceremony at least.  That was good.  It was= a bit difficult because my Dad passed away the morning of his wedding, but= I knew I couldn't leave him then.  Khan has some pictures if he hasn't sho=wn you any yet.  He sent me a couple.  Well I gotta go to bed soon.  I'll d=o a better job keeping in touch.  It's just been a little difficult lately,= I'm sure you understand.  Don't work too hard.=20Eric=206031 North Arrowana LaneHouston, TX  77036USA=20Check out these links re: my ebay success.  I got some heat about the chron= article.

Anyway just wondering if you knew anything about this group, if it's something I should look at.  Thanks buddy.
