Kemah is always fun, watching the boats, drinking a longneck.  We all walked in the Enron MS walk last weekend. It was fun but I had to carry Ben half of the way which gave be a better workout than I anticipated.  Had a date with Deanne Sat night . We went to "Bridget Jones Diary". It was a good chick movie.  Went to church and The Woodburn Tulip festival on Sunday.  Pretty neat to see fields of tulips.  Tell the kids we love them and are looking forward to good reports on their various activities.Love UPhil

Kids are 8,5 and almost 2.  You can probably picture what our life is like.  Everyone is fine.If you come up here for a game let me know, also if your son needs anything don't hesitate to ask.  I wish I sould sit in a sports bar with you and watch a game.  Not a lot of people to watch it with up here.  Haven't played golf in a long time.   I like your enthusiam when it comes to the Huskers.  I hope you are right and they decide to bring the wood every game.   I'm supposed to have some tickets through one of the brokers but haven't got them yet.  I bet I get stiffed.  I think $150 should get me in there otherwise but think I's rather watch it on tv for that much jack.  I'll get back with you later.pp

That's a= natural reaction when something you are so proud of is criticized.  I must= admit I almost e-mailed you after reading your pre-game article.  What irr=itates my sensitivities is when it is pointed out that NU players have had =trouble with the law.  These episodes, misdeameanors or not are not somethi=ng any husker fan is proud of.  Surely there are players in every program w=ho have fights with their girlfriends, or who drink too much and don't have= the sense to leave a party when asked.  My problem is that whenever a NU p=layer messes up, it is news.  It's as if there is a Lincoln Journal Star re=porter with an office in the Lincoln PD complete with scanners, just waitin=g for some "news" to break.  I don't think ISU or any other school has such= a spotlight put on them.  College kids everywhere do such things and pay f=or them quietly.  I don't wish we knew about every infraction at every scho=ol.  It would be nice if reporters could put things in perspective and stic=k to the event they are covering.  This all started when we were the defend=ing and still contending National Champions who had the leading Heisman can=didate in the backfield.  The Lawrence Phillips issue back then was news be=cause of the Heisman hype and because of the severity of his offense.  He b=ecame the posterboy for abuse of females, and perhaps rightfully so, but en=ough already.  Leave us alone until, God forbid, we end up with another Law=rence Phillips.Before I ramble on about this sensitive issue.  Let me thank you for your p=ost game article which was fair and balanced.  You are right, Most NU fans =are good, a few of us are not good fans or role models.   NU fans continue =to wish ISU and Iowa the best.  Most of us are happy to see the Iowa teams =do well.  Take care.

jeffrey.miller@enron.com,jeffrey.miller@enron.com,jeffrey.miller@enron.com,Subject: RE: Cornholios,yeah,  the Offense was very unhuskerlike, except for Crouch, He had 150 yards passing which was fairly good.  The line was not ready for such an aggressive D this early.  I do think TCU has a great Defense as evidenced by their #1 Defense ranking last year. Evidently they had some depth as well becasue they lost half of their starters to Graduation/NFL.  The bright spot was the Defense giving up only 165 yards of TOTal yards.  their only score came on a broken play that went for 67yards.  We were also lucky that Casey Printers pulled a muscle on that play.  We played 2 true freshman alot on the D and they were very good.  The D should be faster and more aggressive than last year.  The Domers think they have a chance now that we only scored 21 on TCU.  I say TCU is better than people think, but I'm glad we didn't open with NotreDame.  I got your pictures.  Your daughter is really cute.How will the aggies be?

How is this different than all of the other retail contracts that you service?One concern that I had was if they opted to go for direct access and still had provisions to change their load on short notice(real time) this would cause some big problems for our real time group. To my knowledge, we don't currently have any contracts like this.  Is this the reason UC-Davis wasn't included in the original deal with the UC System?  Can you give me a call or an e-mail?  The number below is correct.Thanks!

I gave Susan a few issues that need to be worked on.1) Imports/Exports do not seem to be getting captured inFSP.2)SC trades - some ponts other than CAlifornia were being captured.Some progress was made on Generation.  If entered in Enpower correctly,they appear in FSP. The only problem is once we enter deals in enpower at detailed points, The enpower to caps report does not balance.  We need Enpower to caps to be reformulated to include all NP SP and ZP deals including those at detailed points like sdg1,pandol_6_unit, etc.The 10day test for day ahead is done as far as i'm concerned.  Susan was running template comparisons for the 1st thru the 3rd. which may need some work on our part.

Its only news because of Local papers and police want it to be.  Call the College Station Police and ask if any football players have been involved in any "assaults".

We have them for at least another Month.  I also updated the excel sheet for Mega and created a JUNE folder. June 1 file is also set up in that folder.  I have not pulled the June data into that file.  I have not checked out with anyone for June.  They will be ready to 'check out on Tuesday.  Make a point to call CRC and get any sc trades they have.Callaway is a new deal we have .  The info I have is that it will be a sale for 9MW flat every day for 5years.  This is an EES deal. and will need to be entered on the EES sheet and entered on CAPS.  I think APX1 will be the SC.  Foster and Richter know about this deal. Just make sure it is accounted for as an EES deal, it will not appear in Enpower.There is a wind deal that Elliot did with Edwards Air Force Base.  I don't have enough info on this yet. It starts June 1.
