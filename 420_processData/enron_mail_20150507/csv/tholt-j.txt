I've contacted you all because Regulatory Affairs (Becky and I) are attempting to stop sending you so much paper.  Our goal is to still keep you all informed but in a more effective, efficient, and timely manner.  This is where Livelink comes in.  Livelink is a web-based tool that you all will be able to enter from the Govt.Affairs homepage.  In Livelink, there will be the filings, maps, rate increases, etc. that we usually send you via interoffice mail.  In addition, the files from the file room will eventually be added.Livelink is only going to be as successful as what's put into it.  This is where you and your group comes into play.  Becky and I don't want to put "junk" into it.  We want what's relevant to you and your team.  Of course, this is all relative.  What's important to one person and/or group is not going to be high priority to another. We will have a meeting Wednesday, the 17th to meet and discuss what's in livelink and look to you all for your valuable input on what you would like to see that's relevant to your team.  Please reply to the invite and/or send comments.Thanks,Melinda

No hand-outs were provided.Calculation of Receipt Point CapacityTopock  540 mmcf/dEhrenberg 1250 mmcf/dNeedles 800 mmcf/dWheeler 800 mmcf/dNew Receipt PointsKramer Junction 200 mmcf/dHector Rd 50 mmcf/dBoth will be available around Feb 1Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows CalculationCurrently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.New Calculation, Changes and DisplayBased on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.OFO DeclarationName changes from overnominationCan declare before any CycleProvide 2 hour noticePost on Gas SelectShow OFO Calculation on Gas SelectWindowsReason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into systemCalculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO'sNow customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.Scheduling Changes-Nov 1Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycleCopy confirmed nomsAll noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.2 Hour NoticeSocal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFONominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.Use Elapsed Pro-Rata RulesExpected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cutCycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cutCylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cutWindows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled VolumesCycle 1                                    Cycle 2Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.Winter Balancing RulesEffective Nov 1-March 31No changes.All customers must comply.Minimum delivery requirements50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)70% of daily usage depending on storage level70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min90% of daily usage depending on storage level90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.Look at storage graph on Gas Select.

There is an awfull lot of pressure being put on El Paso at the meeting to path their system.  The full requirements customers have to submit to El Paso 4 different load profiles-Becky has the details.  It sounds , though, that full requirements may be addressed in the proceeding. However, that does not mean that any transport will open up to Arizona. The conference call was a nonevent.  I guess we are trying to find out how Socal calculates its WACOG.  So we want to put pressure on them to get details.  We want to put pressure on all of the state commisiions to allow LDC to hedge and not be punished for it.
