Although I can tell you that I definitely have not had time to pick up a book lately.  Our day consists of -- wake up at 5, feed Erin, get ready, drive to work, work, drive home, feed the baby, eat dinner, play with the baby, bathe the baby, go to sleep -- and I'm really lucky if I'm not awakened at 2 or 3 am.  But, it's ALL worth it.  I would be glad to give you a recommendation -- any idea where you want to be?  There are a few people hiring right now for sure.
