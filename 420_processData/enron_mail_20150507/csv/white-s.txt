He informed me that the top-levels were typically put in at one region level per roll.  I had Zhiyun re-run the killed deals calc (post id 15667).  Everyone should go back into the rolls and put the top-levels into their correct regions also adjusting the Schedule E's.  This is why the differences are so large in certain areas and the only way we can start to pinpoint the problem is to find the problem spots.I have also identified where the $4.6 MM difference for OPPD arose from.  Deal # 11678.04 has not been transferred into the East Bank book.  In addition, there are no volumes in this deals; however, if you look back to the official 11/30/2001 calc there are volumes for this deal.  It gets more bizarre than that because there were two deals that should have been transferred for OPPD (11678.4, and 564826.1).  Deal 564826.1 was transferred but the valuations are approximately $4MM different.  I have printed detail for deals 11678.4 and 564826.1 (they are in Casey's chair) as of the 11/30/2001 official calc.  I have also printed deal 564826.1 in the 11/30/2001 bankruptcy calc.  I noticed that I cannot see any swap detail reports for the bankruptcy calc.  Please re-calc and generate these reports as they will probably be important as we dig into details.Other than Andrea who has to perform some IT testing, no one should be working (or playing) on anything other than trying to get these Schedule E's and top-levels figured out.  The task is actually very important as there will be many decisions made off of these numbers.Thanks,Stacey

Before we start this process please recalc the East, West, Eastbank, & Westbank portfolios to AdHoc.  Check one more time that only terminated counterparties are in the Bank portfolios and all terminated counterparties are out of the East and West portfolios.Before kicking off the calcs, double check the specific deals that are listed on the Physical Power Terminated spreadsheet.  I believe there were whole deals moved to the Bank portfolios by Will that should never have been moved, because they were already liquidated in November.  Also, I have attached a new copy of the physical terminations.  There is one counterparty (TXU) added to the list that we need to take care of before kicking off the calcs.  In addition to adjusting deal entry for TXU we also need to adjust scheduling.Before recalcing the Bank portfolios, please contact Debbie Brackett or Stephanie McGinnis (4-2022) to make sure that they have extracted the data they need from the portfolios.We should still be calcing on 'No True-up'.  Casey, I know you said this probably will still cause us trouble.  At this point, we are going for reasonableness with numbers.  All the previous top-levels in our rolls (as of the 3rd or 4th) will stay as top-levels until we know the exact amount of cash that is being attributed to power.  The remaining prior day values will be held in Schedule E for Georgeanne to move to a balance sheet account.  These top levels should match the total value of your Bankruptcy portfolios.  Where I think it will get tricky is that we are calculating as of the 18th and have transactions in the Bankruptcy portfolio that are before the 18th and therefore will fall into your liquidations.  These numbers will also have to moved to Schedule E.When running through liquidations in the East and West portfolios, we will not be flat.  Currently, we are liquidating all non-terminated counterparties other than those specifically negotiated out of by scheduling.  (Thresa and I are working on this with Corry and Cara).  The settlements group will figure out what the counterparty agrees with through the check-out and ultimately the clean-up process.Tomorrow should be a blast - I can't wait!!!Stacey

(Reminder:  the increments are changeable)  The data is imported from PortCalc into an Excel pivot table.  The pivot table is then used to show how the various Greeks (delta, gamma, theta and Vega) change for each trader's book, generally with a 3 month look ahead.  The data can also be sorted by and grouped by other criteria, if requested, such as by region and delivery date These reports are given to the East option traders only.Thanks,Stacey

Only the curves applicable to the East NERC regions are being marked as a daily and monthly volatility; therefore, no blending is needed for daily options (they point directly to the daily vols) or monthly options (they point directly to the monthly vol).  All curves applicable to the West NERC regions are still being marked as intramonth and monthly; therefore, blending is needed to provide a volatility for daily options.	The best rules to be in place for the blending vs. non-blending would be based on curve.  East curves do not blend.  West curves do blend.  Therefore, ANY daily or monthly option in the East would not have to blend.  The potential problem that could be caused by making the rule apply to portfolios is that, for example, the East portfolio could potentially enter into an option at a West region (curve) and that transaction would need to use blended curves even though it is in the East portfolio.	Options at a different expiry than daily or monthly is another problem.  Are there different blending rules embedded in the code for weekly expiration?  We still need to discuss this.	I would be happy to all sit down and have a meeting concerning this issue whenever everyone is comfortable enough that we know all the current rules.  Let me know.Stacey

I still have a job and will more than likely go to the 'new co.' - the piece that UBS has bid for.  Currently, we are extremely busy trying to close out old business at the same time as setting up details of the new business.Russell and I are both well, probably working too hard.  What is new with you?StaceyIf you get a chance give me a call - would love to talk to you.  713-853-1870 (w) 281-382-5215 (cell).  I tried the number listed on this e-mail for you, but it just rang and rang.
