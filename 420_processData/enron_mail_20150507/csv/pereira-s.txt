The trading groups (the ones that used to make all the money) are still working full days.  We're trying to trade, but our number of counterparties decreases daily.  I don't know if we'll make it through the next week.  They are laying off people this week, so I hear, in other groups.  I don't know who has been notified.  We may all be walking out the door soon.As for the kids, Yes, Kali still believes in Santa Claus.  I don't know if she knows and is not fessing up!  We'll be here in Houston for Christmas.  Give us a call when you get here; we'd love to see you.  Thank goodness I already bought the kids' Christmas gifts.  They haven't written their lists yet, though.  We went to a dude ranch in Bandera, TX for Thanksgiving weekend.  The kids had a blast and want to go back next year.  I guess I'll be updating my resume this weekend.  It looks pretty bleak.Talk to you soon.Susan

Unfortunately, that's a daily occurrenc=e.=20I have been employed with Enron since May of 1993, when Enron purchased LRC=.  I was very skeptical of Enron back then and was unsure of my future with= the company.  As time went on, I got more comfortable with the Enron way a=nd learned how to survive and even be a little successful here.  I became a= believer in the things Enron could accomplish, a champion of our hard-nose=d, driven executives (at least some of them).  I bought Enron stock and hel=d on to those valuable options.Over the last 18 months, my coworkers and I have viewed the weekly, sometim=es daily, selling of Enron stock and exercising of options by our top execu=tives (past and present and including you).  We came up with all kinds of r=easons that the executives would be doing this -- they're so overly compens=ated that they have to cash out some every now and then, divorce settlement=s, mistress settlements, buying a new home in Aspen, buying an island in th=e Caribbean, etc., etc. etc....  We never wanted to admit that they knew so=mething we didn't.  Things were great, weren't they?  Jeff Skilling told us= that Enron was going to be the "World's Leading Company."  He even put the= goofy acronyms on his car license plate.  He told us gas traders in Februa=ry how the stock was going to $126 by the end of the year. Now, being the c=ynic that I am, I didn't believe the $126, although I have to admit I was h=opeful; I figured that if Jeff had the audacity to throw out a number that =high, then it was reasonable to expect the stock to be fairly stable, i.e.,= +/- 20%. =20Needless to say, I didn't sell my stock and didn't exercise any more option=s.  In fact, I bought more stock when it first started going down.  I'm afr=aid that there are many more just like me.  I'm fortunate in that I have ma=ny working years ahead of me (where, I don't know) to try to build up my sa=vings again.  Many others are not that fortunate.  So many have spent their= entire careers here, helping to build this company up.  They were looking =forward to retiring soon and enjoying the fruits of their labor.  And let m=e remind you that their retirement accounts were in many cases a lot less t=han a month's compensation for you.  Now even that is essentially gone.  Ot=her employees were just ready to cash in some of their options to pay for t=heir children's college tuition.  The stories are too numerous to list, and= the more I think about it, the more sickened I become.It is painfully obvious to me and my coworkers, as well as the rest of the =industry and Houston, that Enron's executives knew that there were skeleton=s in the closet and began cashing in ahead of this freefall.  The employees= and the rest of the world were fed a bunch of half-truths and mystery mumb=o-jumbo.  There should be an accounting for this behavior.  You and your co=horts have ruined so many lives.  Think about that while you're spending yo=ur millions.....Susan PereiraENA Gas Trader

Since the restaurant does not need the entire area, maybe they could use the front part or the middle part.  If they used the middle part, we could reclaim the front and back and put plantings and/or suitable trees.  Also, Dora suggested they use some kind of decking instead of concrete.  Maybe when P&Z meets again we can flesh out some of these ideas.  Next time you talk with Dan, please mention using only a part of the area.Thanks,Susan

Sweet Mesquite expressed an interest in =some outdoor seating area and Dan Muniza wanted some warm fuzzies that the =City would allow Center America/Sweet Mesquite to use City easement  along =Braes for a patio area.  Currently, that area is being used for parking.  T=he proposed patio would be above the street level by around two feet or so.=  Basically, Center America would extend the existing sidewalk that abuts E=ckerd's out to the street and fence in the whole patio area with decorative= fencing or brick.  They would also include some plantings, greenery, etc. = David Moss is checking with David Allums (city attorney) about any potenti=al liability with Center America/Sweet Mesquite using City easement.  Also,= there is an existing water line under this parking area that would need to= be relocated closer to the street.  I think David will be able to give us =a cost estimate on this at our next meeting.  David did mention that the li=ne is in need of replacement anyway.As for the new Eckerd's building, Dan Muniza did not have the proposed elev=ations from Eckerd's yet.  He's expecting to get something this week.  He's= reserving the right to pick something that will blend in with the existing= center.Also, there was some concern at the last City Council meeting about the add=itional parking needs of a Sweet Mesquite.  Dan Muniza indicated that the p=arking behind the center is open to anyone.  They prefer that it be availab=le for Center America employees and tenants during the day, but it's wide o=pen after 5 pm.David Moss will be contacting everyone soon about scheduling a meeting to d=iscuss the City's proposed landscaping ordinance.

laurie.ellis@enron.com,laurie.ellis@enron.com,laurie.ellis@enron.com,Subject: RE: Superior-Unwinding of Sonat Trigger Deal,Laurie-No. I have not put a new ticket in the system.  I wrote up a paper ticket and Alejandra Chavez adjusted the term  of the existing sitara ticket.  I'm not sure how it is supposed to be handled.  You might check with Alejandra and Kam Keiser.  Apparently, we've had some similar deals with other counterparties.  The NYMEX desk people told me that Credit doesn't want us paying one lump sum for unwinds.  Do you have any instructions concerning this, given our current financial situation??Thanks,Susan Pereira
