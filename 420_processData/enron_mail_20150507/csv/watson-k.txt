Here are my thoughts...For purposes of this discussion, let's just talk about how the Dynegy, San =Juan to SoCal Needles firm transport for 35,000 MMBtu/d for Calendar 2003 c=ould impact our fuel risk.  Dynegy will not be giving us fuel in-kind for t=his transaction.  All fuel needed for scheduled volumes on this contract wi=ll have to be provided by TW.   In a normal year TW over collects approxima=tely 25,000 MMBtu/d in fuel.  Because we will now need some of this over co=llected amount to provide the fuel for the Dynegy deal, we actually have so=mething less than the 25,000 MMBtu/d for the total 2003 fuel over collectio=n.  To make the math easy to follow for purposes of discussion, let's assum=e after all of the Index to Index deals for 2003, we will only have 20,000 =MMBtu/d of over collected fuel on the system.  We will need the remaining 5=,000 MMBtu/d as fuel for the Index to Index deals.  Let's also assume that =we have hedged or plan to hedge (by means of the whole calendar year, seaso=nally or monthly) the 20,000 MMBtu/d of 2003 over collected fuel.  The rema=ining 5,000 MMBtu/d of over collected unhedged fuel is what will be used to= provide the fuel for the Dynegy deal. =20It is my thought that the price risk question surrounds the 5,000 MMBtu/d o=f the remaining over collected fuel that is not hedged.   On any day where =Dynegy would schedule the full 35,000 MMBtu/d to flow, the fuel actually bu=rned on that day for Dynegy would have the same value as all other shippers= who provided in-kind fuel on that same day.  The other shipper's in-kind f=uel (I'm referring to the 5,000 MMBtu/d that is not hedged) is what is actu=ally used to provide fuel for Dynegy.  On this particular day, we do not ha=ve additional adverse price risk.  However, on any day that Dynegy does not= have the full 35,000 MMBtu/d scheduled to flow, we have an opportunity los=s on the value of this fuel.  If Dynegy does not flow all or any volumes on= their contract on any given day, there is no fuel burned.  This means that= we now have extra gas, that was not previously hedged, in the pipe provide=d by the other in-kind shippers that we do not need for Dynegy on this part=icular day.  Now we are subject to selling this extra gas at current cash p=rices verses having the ability to hedge this volume ahead of time at a pri=ce that we felt meet our fuel hedging strategy, thus creating an opportunit=y loss. =20Would you agree that our risk is when Dynegy does not flow?  Would you agre=e that there is no additional price risk when Dynegy does flow? =20Thanks, Kim.

They are located near our H=otel Firenze between the Spanish Steps and Plaza Del Popolo.  The rate is 4=30,000 Lire (approximately $215).  It's $25 more than the Sheraton but we w=on't have to taxi between the city center and the outskirts of town which g=ives us more flexibility to easily scoot back to the hotel as we fade with =jetlag and eat dinner in town after a nap.

I believe that we still have a 6 hour drive to Lucca, but that will put us there sooner than the overnight ferry to Livorno with a 2 hour drive.  She is also confirming the car and rate for us (approx $742 for each car). FYI, I have received a few more faxes from available Rome Hotels, but none of them have a better location that what we have booked and a few of them were even more expensive than what we have booked.  Janell is on the hunt for a Florence hotel.  I will prepare faxes in mass for Florence tonight and send them out tomorrow.  Dorothy called me yesterday and wanted to know how our plans are coming.  She and Tom are very sad that they will not be able to join us.  I told her we will drink for them everyday and have them in our thoughts.  She is doing well and hopes to return to the office in about three weeks on a part time basis.Also, John and I are confirmed in a Rome hotel for the 11th-13th which is only about 5 blocks from the train station where we will return the cars.

Please continue to talk about Red Rock with these folks.  What would Aquila like to see TW offer?  What are their thoughts about the West markets?  What could TW do to get Aquila to be more active on our pipe? FYI, I am coming into the office Wed morning.  I will be in EB4179.  I need to meet with Martha and pack up this office.

wwatson@hts-la.com,wwatson@hts-la.com,wwatson@hts-la.com,Subject: FW: secret anniversary trip,X-FileName: KWATSON (Non-Privileged).pstBill, To get hard to find tickets, go to the Plaza Hotel (borders Central Park near FAO Schwartz) entering through the front door, proceed ahead around the big lobby/tea area around to the right and find a woman in a closet sized booth (literally a closet).  Cast members turn tickets over to her to sell that they are given for their shows.  She is completely independent from the hotel and I'm sure she pays huge rent for the tiny space that she has.  They are always wonderful seats to and usually run around $100+ for each ticket.  It is always a worth-it splurge if it is for a play you want to see.  I used to have her card, but it is long gone by now.  You might be able to call the Plaza and inquire as to her name and number and call ahead.  Otherwise, just stop in as soon as you get in town. Rent is OK, but if this is your first and maybe only trip to NYC for a while, I would certainly recommend seeing other plays first . I agree with John, your best hotel bet is the Marriott Marquis, which is very nice for a Marriott and the location is the best. Don't forget to eat lox and a bagel for breakfast! Keep us posted.

Since the interconnect is fully reimbursable, Questar is proposing to pay us according to the attached payment schedule vs. paying all of it up front.  Please take a look at this attached schedule and provide me you comments.  If we allow them to pay "along the way" I am interested in making sure it at least matches the timing of our cash outlay of building the interconnect.  The total estimate of $702,000 includes the tax gross up, which may or may not be applicable, so each of these amount may be reduced by the tax amount.Does anyone have any concerns with the timing of the payment schedule?

As you look at this, if for some reason we cannot obtain ElPaso ROW, we will have to look at Plan B which would be to put the metering on our ROW.  Our in-service date is May 1.  If you think that May 1 may be difficult due to receiving the parts/materials on a timely basis because of the issues that vendors may have with us because of recent Enron events, please let me know.

This hotel has a private beach (I think I read somewhere in one of my books that there was a small nominal fee to use the beach) with a private descent (Wahoo!).  They also have private parking at the cheap price of Euro 18 per day and only a thousand (uphill each way) steps to it.  Is this hotel still OK?  I do not know if they have two standard room and two superior rooms or just one of each type available.  Please let me know what your preference is.  I can clarify in my next fax.  If both our preferences are for the same type room and they only have one of each, shall we draw straws or have a pizza eating contest?Also, there was one other hotel in Positano that I looked into before finding Hotel Marincanto for our Sept. trip but they were full.

It is supposed to be wonderful served chilled (when we cooked it in class, we served it warm).  Be careful not to add too much cream since chilling it makes it a little thicker anyway.  Also, after you puree it in the blender, Marie Blanche (our cooking teacher) recommends that you strain all of the chunks out with cheese cloth. She says the reason for this is so that the guests will have a harder time figuring out all of the ingredients.  It is part of the Parisian mystery of cooking. Good Luck! Kim.
