Even so, the amount of savings passed on to consumers is likely to be closer to 5%, the administration added. The discrepancy and its explanation are an extension of the ongoing political squabble between Gov. Gray Davis and Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch. Administration officials said residential customers won't see much relief because recent actions by the PUC have negated most of the gains from lower power prices and greater conservation. Specifically, officials said, the PUC erred in giving business customers too much time to opt out of the state's power-buying system, and in holding up a bond sale to repay expensive energy loans. Lynch disagrees on both points. The real problem, she said again Friday, is that California purchased too much power at too high a price during the energy crisis. The best way to save consumers money, she suggested, is to renegotiate the state's energy contracts. California has been purchasing massive quantities of power since January because the state's large private utilities could no longer do so, and mass blackouts threatened to cripple the state's economy and endanger the public. The utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, ran up billions of dollars in debts because they were forced to buy power for far more than they could legally charge customers. In August, state officials estimated the department's power costs for 2001 and 2002, the time the state plans to be in the power business, at $21.45 billion. The new estimate, released Friday, pares that figure to $17.2 billion. But in what consumer groups angrily called a "jailbreak," Davis administration officials disclosed for the first time Friday that large businesses fled the state's power-buying system en masse this summer, opting to cut their own deals with energy companies rather than shoulder their share of the state's power costs. Big Businesses Bail Out, Leave Tab to ConsumersThe PUC announced in June that it was putting a lid on the so-called direct-access deals because if the businesses left the system, homeowners and other small ratepayers would have to pay a larger share of the costs the state incurred buying power to avert blackouts in the energy crisis. However, the commission did not act until last month, and in the meantime numerous businesses opted out of the state system. Direct-access participation jumped from 2% to 13% of the overall power load being purchased by the California Department of Water Resources, according to the administration's latest numbers. "Unfortunately, all of the savings generated by the improving market conditions will not be immediately passed on to ratepayers," said Pete Garris, who oversees the department's power-buying division. "Put simply, the PUC's delay in suspending direct access means [the state's] costs will have to be recovered from fewer customers and the impact will be greatest on smaller, retail customers." State Treasurer Phil Angelides, who requested that the PUC suspend direct access earlier in the summer, blasted the commission Friday, saying the "stampede" of businesses would shift as much as $8 billion in costs to consumers over the next decade, as they pay for the long-term contracts the state signed this year to ensure a stable source of electricity. "What's happened here is one of the most damaging things that's happened to consumers in this energy crisis," Angelides said. And consumer groups were even more critical, accusing the PUC of letting big business escape the costs of the energy crisis. "The PUC first gave Edison their bailout," said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, referring to the legal settlement recently approved by the commission to rescue the utility. "Now we find that big business is in effect getting bailed out of the energy crisis. These were the two groups, the big business guys and the utilities, that got us in this mess in the first place." But Lynch, the PUC president, said the number conflicted with the commission's figures, which showed direct access participation at roughly 8% of the overall load. That, she said, was similar to the number of businesses participating in direct access at the beginning of the year, a little more than 7%, before the energy crisis erupted. It fell to a low of 2% during the crisis because some energy companies realized they could make more money on the open market and breached their deals with state businesses, she said. Lynch accused Angelides and the Davis administration of revisionist history, saying the commission postponed its decision at the administration's request. The commission then put off the decision again because the Legislature was considering its own solution to the problem, she said. The real problem, Lynch said, is that the state has too much electricity under contract at too high a price. If California had not purchased too much power, consumers would not have to pay for it, she said. "If people are leaving the system, those are fewer people [the state] needs to serve," Lynch said. "The problem, once again, is the long-term contracts. We need to renegotiate these contracts." Also adding to the state's financial burden is the fallout from a $4.3-billion energy loan the state took out this summer that it will not be able to repay in time, driving up the loan's interest rates. The loan was supposed to be repaid by the state's planned $12.5-billion energy bond sale to replenish the billions spent from the state budget on electricity this year. But the bond deal is now in limbo, in part because the PUC has refused to take action on a rate agreement that is required for the bond sale to move forward. As a result, a series of escalating interest rates spelled out in the loan deal are being triggered, which will soon force the Department of Water Resources to make payments to the bankers from its reserve. Davis and Aides Stay Tight-Lipped on StrategyIn a related development, the newly created state public power authority, headed by S. David Freeman, met Friday to consider approving millions of dollars worth of energy conservation and generation projects, but none were adopted because the authority learned it had no money to finance them. If the bond deal ever takes place, the state may be in a position to meet its financial obligations and possibly lower utility rates, which were raised this year in response to the energy crisis. The state may also have the option of floating a smaller bond, though advisors to the governor called that less likely. In another action that could reduce rates, Davis administration officials confirmed Friday that they are planning to renegotiate some of the long-term power contracts, as The Times reported Thursday. The contracts have been criticized by consumer groups and some legislators for being inflexible and expensive. But Davis advisors remained tight-lipped on the specifics, saying only that they have a strategy to convince power companies to open talks. "I don't think it's real smart to tell you that," said Barry Goode, the governor's legal affairs secretary.

Officials of the Department of Water Resources said the state will need $17. 2 billion to buy power through the end of 2002 -- about 20 percent less than previously estimated. The agency began buying power on Jan. 17 when the state's three investor- owned utilities were no longer considered credit-worthy. At the time, prices on the spot market reached upwards of $450 a megawatt hour. Now, however, prices average $30 a megawatt hour. "Circumstances have changed," said Ron Nichols of Navigant Consulting, which is a consultant to the Department of Water Resources. "Conservation has helped, we think the DWR contracts have established reliability in the market. We have broken the back of the spot market." Earlier this year, the state signed 56 long-term contracts with various generators to purchase power. Those contracts, which were inked when prices were at their peak, have come under increasing fire from lawmakers and the PUC, and Gov. Gray Davis' administration acknowledged this week it hopes to renegotiate some of the pacts. But the contracts represent only about a third of the power the state needs every day. The rest comes from the spot market -- purchases made just a few minutes or hours ahead of when they are needed. Prices on the spot market have dropped, in part because the price of natural gas has taken a nose dive. It is unclear whether consumers will see any benefit from the lower power costs. If the projections hold, the state could either lower rates or scale back plans to issue $12.5 billion in bonds needed to pay for the energy purchases. At the same time state energy buyers trumpeted lower costs, they blasted the state Public Utilities Commission for a decision that they say could cost residential and small business consumers $8 billion. Administration officials and state Treasurer Phil Angelides said a PUC decision to delay the suspension of direct access -- the ability of large businesses to bypass utilities and contract directly with generators for power -- will shift higher costs to smaller customers. The PUC proposed the ban on direct access in June but didn't adopt the policy until Sept. 20. During that period, the amount of energy large consumers contracted for through direct access increased from 2 percent to 13 percent. "What's happened here is one of the most damaging things that has happened to consumers during the energy crisis," Angelides said yesterday. He urged the PUC to reverse its decision, setting the date back to July 1. But Lorretta Lynch, president of the PUC, said the delay was at the request of the administration and the Legislature. She also objected to Angelides' numbers, saying that the PUC estimates the direct access load at 8 percent. The commission is awaiting a legal opinion about whether it can make its decision retroactive to July 1, and action will be taken at the next PUC meeting, she said.

The data adequacy vote means an application has been accepted as having sufficient information to proceed with the commission's approval process.Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Roseville Energy Facility LLC unit has proposed building a 900-MW natural gas-fired plant in Sacramento, Calif., to be online by the fourth quarter of 2004. The construction cost will be $350-$450 million for the combined-cycle project, which will undergo a 12-month review process by the commission. GWF Energy LLC has applied to build the 169-MW Tracy Peaker Project, a simple cycle plant in the San Joaquin Valley, Calif., that would be online by July 2002. Peaker plants operate during times of high electricity demand. The company also applied to build the 91-MW Henrietta Peaker Project, 20 miles south of Hanford, Calif., which would consist of two turbine generators and come on line by June 2002. Electricity generated from the two peaker projects will be sold to the state's Department of Water Resources under a 10-year contract. -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872; jessica.berthold@dowjones.com

My only comment is that, in our view, the price cap (which would cover ALL capacity in the secondary market) is simply bad economic policy and won't address any problems--in fact it will only create problems. (From a practical perspective, I'm not even sure that the Commission can successfully "regulate" prices in the secondary market.) Will the commission change the price cap provisions of the decision based comments advising against them?  Very unlikely.   But when the caps create problems (and they will), I want to have been on record advising the Commission of why caps are bad economic policy and pointing out the bad outcomes that caps will cause.  I think that it's very important to point out the downside of caps and to be on record against them.   That said, I don't want the comments to be so negative as to cloud support for the decision; nor do I think the Commission will change the cap based on our comments.  Other than that, EES and ENA can sign on.  Anyone have any objections to pointing out the fact that price caps are ill-advised? Best,Jeff

Davis' high approval ratings had little to do with his actual performance, or any personal affection among Californians for their cool and distant governor. He was just the fortunate beneficiary of good times and good feelings. Today, a dark cloud has descended on the state. A sharp decline in the economy, particularly high-tech sectors, a stubborn energy crisis and, most recently, the terrorist hijackings and murderous crashes of California-bound airliners have left Californians worried about their personal safety and economic security, and they're looking for someone to blame. Davis' approval ratings began to decline early this year as the energy crisis hit home and it became apparent that he had failed to take the initiative in heading off the worst aspects of the situation. And they have continued to sag, thus presenting the governor with a series of interlocking tests as he begins his campaign for re-election in 13 months. The seriousness of Davis' decline was underscored late last month in a statewide Field Poll indicating that, at the moment, most California voters would prefer former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan to Davis. History indicates that Davis should still be favored to win a second term, but if Riordan does become the Republican candidate, he would have at least an outside chance of unseating Davis. Davis' chief problem is that he will be running for re-election in what will almost certainly be sharply declining economic circumstances, the product of a slowdown already under way and the plummeting consumer confidence in the wake of the terrorist hijackings. State tax revenues are in a nosedive, running a billion dollars under projections in the first three months of the fiscal year, and Davis will be compelled to make multibillion-dollar slashes in state spending that will irritate important constituent groups. How big the state budget hole will become is anyone's guess. There's a distinct tendency for state revenues to plummet far faster and further in an economic downturn than official forecasts, just as they rise faster and higher in a recovery than the bean counters project. Some analysts believe that Davis' problem could rival the $14 billion deficit that predecessor Pete Wilson confronted in 1991. Wilson swallowed hard and agreed to the largest state tax increase in American history. However large the state's fiscal problem may be, it will be much, much larger if the state money Davis spent on power purchases this year cannot be recovered from a proposed bond issue. And the $12.5 billion bond issue is on indefinite hold because the Public Utilities Commission, consumer groups and Pacific Gas and Electric are opposing the administration's demand that past and future power purchases be covered by ratepayers without review. It's apparent now that the long-term contracts the administration signed are much too expensive, which is why Davis' own appointees to the PUC are balking. Davis could try to renegotiate the contracts, but that would be admitting that he and his advisers erred in the first place. Or he could accept the Legislature's proposal, contained in legislation on his desk, that only past power purchases be guaranteed and that future contracts be subjected to the scrutiny that private utilities' purchases must receive. But Davis is insisting that he'll veto the measure. The effect of the current flap over bonds and power contracts, as well as Davis' months-long effort to provide a bailout for financially strapped Southern California Edison, and his lackadaisical performance earlier in the energy game, will undermine the governor's claim for a second term. He comes across as someone who dithered when he should have acted, and signed too-expensive contracts even as the power market was contracting. That, and Californians' increasing apprehension about their future, will make his re-election a much dicier prospect than he had envisioned.   _____  The Bee's Dan Walters can be reached at (916) 321-1195 or dwalters@sacbee.com <mailto:dwalters@sacbee.com>.

He's drafting the letter that Burton will send to Loretta re: what to do about DA.I've given Kip the quotes from Angelides re: State's fiscal position will remain STRONG through JULY 2001 irrespective of whether the bonds are issued.  Kip was not aware of the quotes and was anxious to get them.I reminded Kip that the only reason anyone's given to suspend DA is the urgent need to issue the bonds, but now, even the Treasurer has admitted that there is no urgency to issue the bonds.I told Kip that the letter to Loretta should say 1) there is no longer any need to suspend DA whatsoever, 2) the PUC should commence ratemaking proceedings immediately to ensure that there is no cost-shifting to small rez and biz customers as a result of DA and 3) the PUC should deliver to the Legislature a study recommending any enhancements, modifications, etc. that should be made to the program to ensure that DA is maintained while ensuring that granny is not harmed.He said he would see what he could do and said that he would likely get back to us.There is a concerted effort underway to get the PUC to reject outright at tomorrow's meeting the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC, and DWR's proposed rev. req.  The reason:  no urgency anymore.  Let's take a little time and get it right.Best,Jeff

Under federal law, any three creditors can force a company to file for bankruptcy if they are owed a combined $10,775. The five generating companies collectively are owed hundreds of millions of dollars, although the exact total is not known.The letter was a significant step in maneuvering over Edison's fate--a dance that has gone on for months but now appears to be nearing its close. Edison has been reaching deals with some of its creditors, but has kept others waiting. Some power generators, in turn, have been threatening to push Edison into bankruptcy, although so far only Mirant Corp. and Reliant Energy have publicly embraced that idea. And Gov. Gray Davis and legislative leaders have continued to debate a plan that the governor believes could avoid a bankruptcy.The letter, sent by William Bates III, a Palo Alto attorney representing the five power generators, expressed frustration that Edison so far has been unwilling to work out a repayment plan with large power producers. Under the Edison rescue plan that the Legislature debated and ultimately adjourned without passing earlier this month, Edison would have settled with its smaller creditors but been left with $1 billion in debt to big power sellers."This group of creditors is significant in both number and amount and deserves and requires to be dealt with as such," says the letter to Edison's private attorney, Thomas B. Walper of Munger, Tolles & Olson in Los Angeles."We would be willing to discuss any ideas SCE has" about an agreement to repay its debt, the letter continues, "but we don't want to waste anybody's time. Thus, as a first step we want to know whether SCE is interested in negotiating. . . . Please give us a simple 'yes' or 'no' answer to that question."Of course, we reserve all our rights and remedies in the event that SCE does not want to meet on these terms or we cannot reach a mutually satisfactory agreement," Bates wrote.The five companies are Reliant, Mirant, Dynegy Corp., Enron Corp. and Puget Sound Energy, which is the biggest investor-owned utility in Washington state.Edison officials refused to comment.The frustration on the part of the power generators appeared to mount Tuesday, when Edison announced that it had reached an agreement to pay off its $14-million debt to the city of Long Beach, which sold Edison electricity produced at a trash-fueled power plant on Terminal Island.Edison has also reached repayment plans with many small and renewable power producers who collectively are owed $1.2 billion."Edison can take steps to assure that all creditor classes are treated equally," said Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant Energy in Houston, which is owed $100 million to $200 million by Edison.A spokesman for Atlanta-based Mirant, which is also owed more than $100 million, sounded a similar note. "It is time SCE made clear when, how much and even if it is going to pay us," Patrick Dorinson said.So far, other creditors have balked at the idea of pushing Edison into bankruptcy, believing that a judge would probably consider a bankruptcy petition premature until after the Legislature meets Oct. 9 in a special session to deal exclusively with Edison's plight.Davis, who insists that Edison should not be allowed to file for bankruptcy, ordered the new session earlier this month after legislators adjourned without passing any legislation that would shrink Edison's debt.Other Creditors Take NoticeSenate leader John Burton, (D-San Francisco), has said that any such bill would have to guarantee that the burden of paying off the utility's $3.9-billion debt does not fall on homeowners and small-business owners.The letter from the five generators caught the attention of other creditors who have so far played along with SCE's strategy of winning a legislative rescue."From our perspective, the days of luxury for Edison are over," said John Moorlach, Orange County treasurer. The county holds $1 million of defaulted SCE bonds in its retirement plan.Moorlach said he believes that if SCE does not quickly reach an agreement with the generators, they will push the utility into Bankruptcy Court."By doing this, the generators are trying to show that they are making a good-faith effort to reach a settlement first," Moorlach said.But Jay Lawrence, spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, said his members believe the move by the generators shows they have backed off from an immediate involuntary bankruptcy petition filing, at least while they try to open negotiations with SCE."We still want to see a legislative solution, and we are against bankruptcy," Lawrence said.Edison provides electricity to 11 million people. It racked up the $3.9-billion debt over the past year as it purchased high-priced electricity in the fledgling market California created under a 1996 deregulation plan. The state's deregulation plan included a rate freeze that barred Edison from passing the full cost of the power it bought on to customers.By January, Edison's debt had grown so heavy that power sellers refused to deal with the utility. The state had to step in with taxpayer money to keep electricity flowing. So far, the state has spent $10.7 billion on power purchases.Edison's counterpart in Northern California, Pacific Gas & Electric, suffered the same financial squeeze in the state's dysfunctional market. PG&E took itself into bankruptcy in April.The generators' demand came on a day when Edison officials said they were close to winning an agreement from bankers to delay collecting on $200 million in loans until Oct. 19.Shares of Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison, rose almost 5% Friday to close at $13.16 on the New York Stock Exchange.*Times staff writer Nancy Rivera Brooks contributed to this report.

In addition, it appears that the proposal would give the Commission some latitude to enact retroactivity back to July 1 if deemed necessary (this is unclear and we're trying to get more details on this provision).Three key senators have sent a a letter to the PUC asking the PUC to provide recommendations to the Legislature on the conditions under which DA should be re-instated (since the letter is dated September 18th--though sent only yesterday--it appears that the Senate had an idea that the PUC was going to suspend).KEEP IN MIND THAT THE DECISION HAS NOT BEEN VOTED ON YET AND THE PROVISIONS LISTED ABOVE MAY CHANGE.We'll report back as soon as something happens.For folks who want to listen in, the number is:415.228.4550code = 92105Best,Jeff

Edison hasassured me that it will not seek bankruptcy and that it believes that itscreditors will continue to show restraint."###California Senate adjourns without voting on plan to save struggling utility JENNIFER KERR, Associated Press WriterSaturday, September 15, 2001 ?2001 Associated Press URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2001/09/15/national0541EDT0485.DTL>(09-15) 02:57 PDT SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The state Senate adjourned early Saturday without voting on a plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, and Gov. Gray Davis called an emergency legislative session for next month to try again to help the struggling utility. As the California Legislature rushed to pass hundreds of bills and finish the 2001 session, a $200 million program to help the state's neediest schools won approval. So did bills to give driver's licenses to immigrants seeking citizenship and improve working conditions for shepherds. But senators remained cool to Davis' idea of bailing out Southern California Edison. They failed to vote on the measure after it was approved last week by the Assembly, which also adjourned early Saturday. "We didn't take it up because we didn't want to embarrass the governor," said President Pro Tem John Burton. "It would have been a rip-off of residential people to help big business and bail out a corporation." The deal's quiet death closed more than five months of work since Davis first announced the plan in April, saying the state would pay $2.76 billion for Edison's transmission system and let the utility sell consumer-backed bonds to repay the rest of its $3.9 billion debt. Without the deal, Edison faces bankruptcy along with Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the state's largest utility. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, after amassing about $8.9 billion in debt due to last year's sky-high electricity costs. Edison says it has accrued $3.9 billion in debts. The special session is meant to take another shot at saving Edison from sliding into bankruptcy. "I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness," Davis in a statement after midnight Saturday. "Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done." The new school-improvement program would provide grants of $400 per student to schools with the state's lowest test scores. They will have nearly four years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school. The shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic working conditions that other workers have in state law. Those include a 10-minute rest break for every four hours of work, tools paid for by the employer and toilets, lights and water in housing. It also would put into state law a $1,050-a-month minimum wage for sheepherders. While legislators toiled, Tuesday's terrorist attacks were never far from their minds. Davis joined the Assembly for a brief memorial service that included a procession of lawmakers handing in letters they had written expressing their feeling about the attacks. The Legislature approved sending $1 million from the California Victim Compensation fund to a similar program in New York to help victims of the terrorist attacks. The letters will be printed in a special Assembly Journal. "Here in California, our job is to keep the peace and preach tolerance," said Davis. ?2001 Associated Press

The current PUC proposal would suspend DA retroactive to July 1.In conversations with the Governor's point people in charge of getting the bill passed, they indicated that they are aware of the problems with the PUC proposal and are working to resolve it.We'll continue to provide updates.

The Sacramento Bee <http://www.sacbee.com/about_us/legal>=20Dan Walters: Edison bailout plan is oddest piece of legislation in recent m=emory(Published Aug. 29, 2001)=20Senate Bill 78XX may be the most unusual legislation to hit the Capitol in =decades, in terms of both its content and its convoluted political dynamics=.=20The measure is the latest incarnation of months-long efforts by Gov. Gray D=avis and some legislators to rescue Southern California Edison from joining= its larger cousin, Pacific Gas and Electric, in bankruptcy court. That is =odd unto itself, since state legislation to openly provide billions of doll=ars in benefits to one private corporation may be unprecedented.=20Literally dozens of versions of legislation to bail out Edison have floated= around the Capitol, ever since Davis announced last spring that he had rea=ched agreement with John Bryson, chairman of Edison International, the util=ity's parent corporation. The Edison deal was announced just a few days aft=er PG&E rejected Davis' overtures and took itself into bankruptcy court. Bo=th utilities ran up many billions of dollars in debts buying power in the l=ast six months of 2000 because the state rejected their pleas to raise reta=il rates.=20Edison's -- or perhaps Bryson's -- fear of bankruptcy is another puzzling a=spect of the issue, given the almost cheerful manner in which PG&E placed i=tself in receivership. Edison has spent millions of dollars on lobbying, ad=vertising and other forms of political persuasion, trying to nudge the Legi=slature into passing a rescue plan that lawmakers are clearly reluctant to =do.=20Is avoiding bankruptcy a matter of personal pride for Bryson? Or, as some s=uggest, does it stem from Edison's tardiness in erecting an impregnable fin=ancial fire wall between the utility's assets and those of the parent holdi=ng company, Edison International? Edison scrambled to build a fire wall aft=er bankruptcy loomed, but financial analysts are uncertain that it's as str=ong as PG&E's.=20The dynamics within the Capitol and among various interest groups are equal=ly odd, following none of the patterns that usually explain why politicians= do what they do. Legislators of both parties are all over the map on the E=dison issue, and factions that are ordinarily allied find themselves at odd=s. One example: Liberal consumer groups are strenuously opposing any bailou=t for the utility, while liberal environmentalists like the current scheme =because it would bring thousands of acres of Edison-owned Sierra watershed =under state control.=20Perhaps the most mysterious aspect of the Edison situation is why Davis, or=dinarily the most cautious, commitment-averse of politicians, is making suc=h a crusade of keeping the utility out of bankruptcy court. Why would Davis= put so much of his gubernatorial prestige behind such an iffy proposition =that exposes him to leverage from lawmakers seeking other favors from the g=overnor and, polls indicate, is not popular with voters?=20Harvey Rosenfield, the consumer gadfly who has established a "war room" nea=r the Capitol to fight the Edison scheme, believes that Davis' unusual effo=rts stem from a desire to run for president in 2004 and a fear that Wall St=reet would blackball him if Edison follows PG&E into bankruptcy court.=20Another possible explanation is Davis' decades-long relationship with Bryso=n. The two served together in former Gov. Jerry Brown's administration (Bry=son was Brown's Public Utilities Commission president) and both have strong= ties to the Democratic political organization in West Los Angeles headed b=y Reps. Henry Waxman and Howard Berman, who, in effect, allowed Davis to la=unch his career by winning a West Side state Assembly seat in 1982.=20The most influential member of Edison's board of directors is Warren Christ=opher, a Democratic elder statesman and former secretary of state.

michael.etringer@enron.com,michael.etringer@enron.com,michael.etringer@enron.com,Subject: RE: Timing for QF meeting with Edison,X-FileName: JSHANKM (Non-Privileged).pstMike:A few thoughts:Conference calls on issues of this size don't generally seem very constructive, and I'd suggest that we push for a face-to-face with Edison.If the Legislature doesn't get the MOU out well in advance of September 14th, Edison won't be focused, and I'd suggest that we try and reschedule.No matter the forum, the proposal will be tough to get through, even though it makes alot of economic sense.  It's a big change, and big changes don't come easy, no matter the benefits.  That said, no shots, no ducks.  We ought to make a push.The proposal may not be contingent on Legislation. It might be possible to make it happen at the California PUC.Assignment to DWR would be significant and might require legislation (need to ask a QF lawyer).The proposal makes sense for both the IOUs and DWR, since both want as much "headroom" as possible in rates to cover their respective revenue requirements.Given the pending rate agreement between the CA PUC and DWR, and the utilities' messed-up financial position, DWR is clearly the preferable counter party from credit perspective.All that said, none of the above matters much unless the utility, a critical mass of QFs and the PUC's consumer advocate ("ORA") buy into the idea.I'd propose that we continue with Edison. If Edison bites, then go jointly with Edison to persuade the QFs. If the QFs bite, then go jointly with Edison and QF to try to persuade ORA.On the issue of sleeving through the IOU or DWR, it seems useful to remain flexible on that, though absent general support from the IOUs, QFs and ORA, the entity will be academic.Some preliminary thoughts.  Happy to discuss further.Best,Jeff

Customers with contracts executed as of July 1 would would remain Direct Access customers.The LegislatureThe Assembly version of the Senate MOU (SB 78) has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the Committee.It is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at 6:30 PM PDT today.Amendments on Direct Access were released this afternoon (based on negotiations between Davis' office and business customers):Customers who have consistently been DA since May 2000, including those "involuntarily" returned to bundled service, would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts, and DWR-related exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.Customers who have consistently been on DA between May 2000 and Jan 17, 2001 would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts and DWR-realted exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.Customers who have been on DA between Jan 17, 2001 and August 24, 2001 would be exempt from exit fees related to DWR forward contracts, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.Customer's leaving after August 24th would not qualify for exemptions.There is considerable work underway to make the August 24th date the deadline for contract execution, rather than the date by which the customer must be DASR'd, in order to qualify for the exemptions.Direct Access would not be suspended, however, until 90 days after the bill is signed by Davis (if he signs it), i.e., the "effective date" of the bill.So anyone going to Direct Access between Aug 24 and the effective date would not qualify for any exemptions.After the 90-day period, DA would be suspended until 1.1.03.Self-gen in service consistently from May 200 to August 24 would be exempt from Edison's undercollection and DWR charges.Self-gen that submitted an application to the Energy Commission by August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line.Self-gen that comes on line after August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line, but the total number of exempt MWs in this category would be limited to 250 MWs per year, on a first-come-first-serve basis.At least 30% of any increases in net short due to increases in demand would be reserved for self gen.

In case you hadn't seen it.  Interestingly, no mention of the transfer of the gas assets.Best,JeffPG&E restructuring bid draws state ire By Dale Kasler and Carrie PeytonBee Staff Writers (Published Sept. 21, 2001)In a controversial attempt to dig its way out of bankruptcy, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. proposed a radical restructuring Thursday that would pay off its debts but end state regulation of the utility's valuable hydroelectric and nuclear plants. To make the plan work, PG&E asked a U.S. bankruptcy judge to override state laws and regulations governing power-plant ownership -- a request that triggered immediate opposition from California officials. PG&E said the plan, a complicated blend of asset transfers, debt refinancing and corporate spinoffs, would restore the utility's financial health and creditworthiness without requiring additional rate hikes or a state "bailout." Divorcing the utility from its parent company, the plan would pay off the entire $13.2 billion of debt PG&E accumulated during California's poorly executed era of deregulation. The plan, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco, had the support of a key block of creditors, including independent energy generators, whose approval is necessary to any reorganization plan. But it ran into immediate opposition from Gov. Gray Davis and other state officials, setting up a potentially fierce battle. Despite PG&E's claims to the contrary, they warned the plan could trigger more hikes because PG&E could charge nearly double the amount it currently charges for electricity from the hydro and nuclear plants. The proposal would have the state Public Utilities Commission relinquish control over those plants to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. FERC "has proven over the last 18 months to be ... no friend of the ratepayer," Davis told reporters Thursday. "The PUC, while far from perfect, has been a stronger advocate for ratepayers than the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. ... I'm very wary of PG&E's proposal to transfer all of its generating capacity from a regulated environment to a non-regulated environment." The PUC vowed to fight the plan in court. "I don't think the judge is going to do it," said PUC President Loretta Lynch. Consumer advocates noted that PG&E has been pushing for years to end state regulation of its hydro plants. "It's complete piracy," said Nettie Hoge, head of The Utility Reform Network of San Francisco. "It's the most audacious thing I've ever seen." Filed six months after the utility sought bankruptcy protection, the plan calls for PG&E to be spun off from PG&E Corp., but the utility would transfer its hydro and nuclear plants and some other assets to the parent. That would violate a state law, passed as a response to the energy crisis, prohibiting utilities from selling any of their generating plants before 2006. The law was intended to keep electricity in California hands at a time when out-of-state generators were charging ultra-high prices to PG&E and Southern California Edison. PG&E acknowledged the conflict with state law but said it will ask the bankruptcy court -- a federal entity -- to override the state law. Legal experts said it's not clear whether a bankruptcy judge would ignore state law, and in prior rulings U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali has sided with state officials. "Any federal court would be very reluctant to go in and override state laws," said influential state Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, chair of the Senate Energy Committee. Robert D. Glynn Jr., PG&E's chairman, called the transfer a good deal for customers. He said the electricity from those plants would be sold back to the utility at about $50 a megawatt hour -- "the lower end" of current rates -- under a 12-year contract. But that's almost double the existing rates for those plants, critics said. And Gary Cohen, the PUC's general counsel, said the company would be free to charge market rates when the contract runs out, putting utility customers at the mercy of an independent, unregulated generator. "This is more of what got us into this mess to begin with," Cohen said. Despite the friction between PG&E and the state, the plan requires assurance from the PUC that the utility will be allowed to collect its wholesale power costs in the future from ratepayers, regardless of how high they go. Such assurance will make the utility creditworthy again and able to borrow money to fund the reorganization, PG&E said. The plan also requires approval from federal officials and a "yes" vote from a majority of PG&E's creditors, along with Montali. Glynn said the plan could be completed by December 2002, enabling the utility to resume buying electricity. The state has been buying power for PG&E since January, when it became insolvent. While the PUC raised rates an average of 40 percent this year, the reorganization plan doesn't require another rate hike, Glynn insisted. "From the customers' view, this transaction will be seamless," he said. The same should be true for most employees, he said. The PG&E chairman, whose company has feuded with Davis for months, also boasted that PG&E isn't "asking the state for a bailout or a rescue" -- a jab at Davis' as-yet-unsuccessful effort to sell the Legislature on a multibillion-dollar rescue for Edison. It's unclear what impact PG&E's proposal would have on Edison's attempt to avoid bankruptcy. Edison's creditors, already angered that the Legislature adjourned without passing the Davis-backed plan, might conclude that Edison is better off in bankruptcy and could push the Southern California utility into court, analysts said. The PG&E proposal involves a complicated series of property transfers and bond offerings that would leave the current PG&E Corp. split into two separate, publicly-traded companies. The utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric, would become strictly a retailer and would sell other assets -- including its hydro and nuclear plants, transmission wires and gas pipelines -- to PG&E Corp. for $4.06 billion in cash and IOUs. PG&E Corp. shareholders would receive stock in the slimmed-down utility, although the details of the stock transaction haven't been worked out. The bankruptcy proposal represents the fourth time in three years that PG&E has tried to remove its hydro plants from state control. The PUC and Legislature have resisted because of potential impacts on costs and the environment. Despite the criticism, PG&E said removing those assets from regulators' oversight is essential to making the plan work. Why? Because PUC rules limit how much money the utility can borrow against those assets, said utility spokesman Ron Low. If the assets became property of PG&E Corp., the corporation could borrow a lot more money and use the proceeds to pay its debts. Glynn said he's had "in-depth discussions" with investment bankers about issuing new bonds. Also, by removing the generating plants from PUC oversight, the plan can produce more cash for debt repayment, said credit analyst David Bodek of Standard & Poor's Corp. in New York. If state officials fight the plan, "the question arises, 'How do you discharge these (debts)?' " Bodek said. "Here's a plan that does that." The plan would pay creditors $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in bonds. Creditors with debts of more than $100,000 would get 60 percent in cash and 40 percent in bonds, which will be paid in 10 or more years, said Paul Aronzon, attorney for a committee of unsecured creditors. "There's some credibility here, and it works," Aronzon said of the plan. Gary Ackerman, a spokesman for independent generators, said his group would probably accept the plan, even if it means they have to wait years to get some of their money. Shareholders also endorsed the plan. PG&E Corp.'s stock jumped $1.22, to $15.72, on a day when the markets took another bad fall

SEC Looking Into Possible Conflict on Interest atEnronBy Stephen TaubThe Securities and Exchange Commission has requested that Enron provideinformation regarding certain related party transactions. "We welcome this request," said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and CEO in aprepared statement. "We will cooperate fully with the SEC." Enron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas andelectricity, noted that its internal and external auditors and attorneysreviewed the related party arrangements, the Board was fully informed of andapproved these arrangements, and they were disclosed in the company's SECfilings. "We believe everything that needed to be considered and done inconnection with these transactions was considered and done," Lay added. As we noted on Friday, a limited partnership organized by chief financialofficer Andrew Fastow racked up millions of dollars since 1997 in profitsfrom transactions conducted with the energy company, according to The WallStreet Journal. The partnership reportedly renegotiated the terms of dealswith Enron in ways that boosted its financial positions or reduced its riskof losses. REPORT: E&Y REVENUES NEARLY HALVEDLater this week, Ernst & Young will announce that its revenue growth wasnearly halved in the fiscal year ending June 30, according to the FinancialTimes. Specifically, the Big 5 professional services firm will report that revenuesrose by 7.2 percent to $9.9 billion for the year. In fiscal 2000, revenuesclimbed by 14.1 percent, and by 13.5 percent the prior year. The reason for the drop in revenue growth may be that E&Y fetches most ofits business from the United States, and the U.S. economy tanked in thefirst half of this year. "We have been successful this year, despite the economy and during a periodof great challenge and change in our profession," chairman James Turley toldthe FT. Rival Andersen has already reported that revenues rose 10 percent this yearthrough August 31. Another reason for E&Y's revenue retrenchment: the strong dollar. The firmis expected to announce that revenues increased 12.4 percent in localcurrency terms, according to the paper. Turley told the FT that his clients are less focused on the longer term andare instead concentrating on watching expenses, cash management, debtcovenant issues, and security concerns. "We're going to see more covenantviolations and that will drive restructuring issues," Turley told the FT. Read On!

Marshall, Texas, Sept. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., thelargest energy trader, and its online unit are accused in alawsuit of infringing a Texas company's patent for an electronictrading system.     Bid/Ask LLC of Baird, Texas, formerly called Auction SourceLLC, said it is the sole rights owner of a patent issued in May2000 for a ``Real-time Network Exchange with Seller SpecifiedExchange Parameters and Interactive Seller Participation.''     Houston-based Enron and its EnronOnline unit are improperlyusing that patented technology through its Internet-basedelectronic trading facility, according to the lawsuit filed Sept.17 in federal court in Marshall, Texas. Enron trades commoditiessuch as natural gas and electricity on that trading network.     Bid/Ask seeks a court order blocking Enron from infringingthe patent, and is asking for damages.     EnronOnline began trading electricity and natural gas inNovember 1999. Between then and the second quarter of 2001, it'shandled more than 1 million transactions valued at more than $685billion, the company has said.     Enron, which also trades space on fiber-optic networks, coal,paper and other commodities, had net income of $979 million onrevenue of $100.8 billion in 2000.     ``We have not reviewed the suit, so we can't comment on it,''said Enron spokesman Vance Meyer.     Shares of Enron fell 9 cents to $28.30 today.

Quick side bar:  Edison is very concerned about TURN getting a stay from the court on the EIX/PUC settlement .At the start of the call, Fielder said that he'd fax me the judge's ruling in the TURN appeal, but based on how the call went, I'm not sure if he'll send it. As we conjectured sometime back, Edison is indeed talking about charging us (through a reduced PX credit) for our "share" of the undercollection.Our "share" would be paid down through a reduction in the PX credit over the life of the settlement (presumably about 2-3 years).In short, with one hand Edison would pay us what they owe us; with the other hand, Edison would take it back.Edison intends (as we conjectured) to base the amount of the undercollection owed by DA customers on the percentage of load they represent (e.g., if DA is (was) 10% of the load, they would pay for 10% of the undercollection).We had a very "animated" discussion that went back and forth for some time.  I told him that there's been some gross misunderstanding since his proposal simply doesn't track.Fielder said that they believe their argument is solid.Here's how we left it--he's going to get back to us by COB today or tomorrow and tell us what Edison's calculation is of our "share" of the undercollection.We can discuss further on the call that Wanda's setting up for tomorrow.If you have any questions between now and then, 	give a holler.Best,Jeff

vjw@greenpower.org,vjw@greenpower.org,vjw@greenpower.org,Subject: Go Green Choice,USA: Customer choice can boost 'green power' use-study.NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Giving consumers more energy supply choices could boost use of cleaner electricity sources by 40 percent by the end of the decade, regardless of whether the market is deregulated, a federal study said. But there's a catch. While 10 percent of U.S. electricity already comes from hydro and another 2 percent comes from wind, solar and geothermal sources, stimulating alternative energy demand to meet the 40-percent goal will require more so-called green pricing programs, which are often more expensive to the consumer. According to the study, pushing consumers to adopt electricity alternatives besides coal, oil, gas or nuclear will require utilities to offer green power choices. Indeed, the study showed some customers will 'go green' even if the price is higher than conventional sources. "Market research consistently shows that consumers prefer to receive their power from clean energy sources ... giving consumers energy supply choices can be a powerful mechanism for moving renewable energy into the marketplace," said Blair Swezey, co-author of the study. Swezey works at National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which conducted the study along with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Both organizations are U.S. Department of Energy national laboratories. The study does not advocate competitive markets over regulated markets, but suggests utilities in states without competition should offer their customers green products. "If competitive retail markets fail to materialize, utility programs must pick up the slack," said Ryan Wiser of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, another co-author of the study. CALIFORNIA CAVEAT Green power marketing had seen success in states with retail market competition, such as in California . But in the wake of California 's heavily publicized deregulation crisis, the state seems to have backed away from deregulation, and green power has been one of the victims. "The California experience shows that the transition to competitive retail power markets will not be smooth," Wiser added, noting that at least until California makes up its mind regarding the fate of deregulation, green power programs will remain on the back-burner. More than 85 utilities in 29 states out of more than 500 utilities nationwide give consumers the option to choose to buy power from renewable sources, meaning much of the potential growth for green power use has not yet materialized. Non-hydro renewables provide about 2 percent, or 16,500 megawatts (MW), of all the electricity used in the United States. Hydropower provides about 10 percent. With the expansion of customer choice, the study found the market could support about 6,000 MW of additional non-hydro renewables over the next decade. National Renewable Energy Laboratory, based in Golden, Colorado, is a research center for alternative fuels managed by Midwest Research Institute, technology developer Battelle and global engineering firm Bechtel. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, of Berkeley, California , is a scientific research center managed by the University of California .

We met with Edison yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative CTC claim.?	Edison continues to take a very hard-line, extreme position.  This is it in a nutshell:1.	all customers--bundled and DA alike--"contributed to Edison's undercollection" and all customers must pay it down; 2.	bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and DA customers contributed through the negative CTC;3.	Edison says it will pay ESPs past due amounts related to the negative CTC, but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills--DA and bundled alike--to recover its undercollection. 4.	Edison intends to collect it over approximately 2 years.  Edison estimates that the charge to DA customers over this period would be about $25-27/MWH.5.	Under Edison's plan, Enron would likely end up paying Edison, i.e., the present value of the "undercollection" charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative CTC payment.?	Obviously, with respect to any settlement with Edison, we're extremely far apart and we're therefore considering other 	options.?	In the meantime, the California PUC is engaged in DA and PX credit-related activities beginning next week and Edison 	will try to get the Commission to adopt their proposal.?	We are working with other market participants and gearing up to vigorously oppose Edison's proposal at the PUC.?	We will distribute something on Monday describing our approach and tactics at the PUC for folks to review and 	comment on.?	We are scheduled to meet with Edison again next Thursday to try to knock some sense into them (the probability of 	which is low).If you have any questions, let us know.Best,Jeff

In short, all  	DA customers, irrespective of whether they were taking from Edison at the time that Edison 	accrued the "undercollection," would be "responsible" for paying.  Which means DA customers 	would pay twice for power--once to their ESP and now, again, to Edison.  Is this something 	that your clients care about?  We care quite a bit.One of the big issues is whether there ought to be hearings on all of this, or whether Karl Wood ought to just be able to push rates around based on briefs only.  We feel pretty strongly that hearings are required.  One of our big concerns is that this will be the tip of the iceberg, i.e., Edison will continue on after this in an attempt to force all kinds of costs on customers.  You have a view on whether hearings are required?  More importantly do your clients have an interest in all of this, and will you be there on the 7th?Inquiring minds want to know.Hope you're well.

Understanding that we're really trying to get this thing done and that there's a million different ornaments one could hang on the tree (and bring the thing toppling down), I'll just throw this out for consideration.Seems that as a first-order issue, the judge is either going to approve the settlement or cede to arguments the PUC could make regarding its exclusive ratemaking authority--that is what it is.Assuming that the judge sides in our favor, there remains the chance that the PUC could take the Edison view and charge DA customers for the undercollection, thereby taking back what we achieved in the settlement based on the way our deals are structured with our customers.It would help alot if PG&E took the position at the PUC that (for a variety of reasons) the PUC should NOT tack on DA customers' bills any charges designed to pay down the utilities' undercollection.In a proceeding where Edison and PG&E are on different sides, our chances of prevailing are of course much better.But it likely won't do much good if we have any such deal written explicitly in the settlement document (i.e., PG&E agrees to take our side at the PUC).But if there's any way to do some sort of side deal, outside of the settlement agreement, and if PG&E were amenable, there might be some real value.Again, I know we want to get this thing wrapped up, but thought I'd toss it out there.  We can take it or leave it.Best,Jeff

The utilities said that hearings could be held "sometime later" to determine the exact level of exit fees and how the utilities ought to calcualte the PX credit going forward.A large group of business customers and suppliers disagreed strongly and made a very good case for hearings.There were lengthy arguments in front of the judge, at the end of which the judge decided that it would useful to hold another prehearing conference.The next hearing will be on Dec. 12th.The judge wanted another hearing to permit folks to have the opportunity to respond to the first round of comments on the issues submitted by everyone last Friday.In sum, there will be another hearing on Dec. 12th to further discuss the need for hearings prior to the Commission making decisions on these issues.At this point, it appears that the judge is leaning toward having comprehensive hearings.Of particular note, at the end of the hearing the judge said that he is NOT inclinded to recommend a retroactive suspension of Direct Access to July 1, and that he didnt' think that the PUC commissioner assigned to the case was either. (Worried that he said too much, he then said he couldn't/shouldn't spead for the commissioner.)The judge, and the Commissioner who was at the hearing, went on at length abouth the fact that no one submitted their DA contracts to the PUC (as requested in the document the PUC issued asking folks to submit comments on the issues).Our attorney and the attorneys for suppliers and customers told them that 1) the Commission didn't need to see the actual contracts to get the information necessary via hearings to decide the issues and 2) the Commission doesn't have the authority to ask to see contracts and they ain't likely going to get them without a fight.  Though the probability many not be high, there is at least the chance that the Commission may try to subpoena folks to get the contracts.  Seems prudent to at least be prepared for the possiblity.Interestingly, Edison made a run at getting the Commission to implement by January 1 its proposal to charge all customers--DA and bundled alike--for Edison's undercollection.  The judge (literally) laughed off the request, and then said no.  As a result, Edison didn't get the leverage it was hoping for prior to our follow up meeting with them tomorrow to discuss the Negative CTC issue.The judge also gave the DWR representative a pretty good thrashing, e.g., "why are you here, you refuse to be a party, you refuse to provide info," etc.From today's hearing it appears that DWR will come under increasing pressure to open the kimono and have its numbers scrutinized.  In related news, Davis has announced that he's asked Sempra to meet to renegotiate their DWR contract and said that he'd thus far met with two other generators in "serious negotitations."

Same settlement to unbundle socal that's been before the commission for about a year.  On the commission's agenda to consider, but as has been the case for over year, they've delayed any movement--at least one commissioner doesn't like competition and has the discretion to continue to ask that it be delayed.  Some hold the view that there's a push to try to get it moved, but best guess is 50-50 at this point.  Substantively, though, same thing that's been before them for a very long time, i.e., emulate PG&E's gas accord (more or less) on socal.Best,Jeff

Edison has been successful at peeling off one of the ESPs--New West.  Seems that in exchange for getting paid negative CTCs, New West may have agreed to take the position that all DA customers should be charged for Edison's undercollection. I'm not aware of any other ESPs that are willing to take that position.  The salient quote in New West's "supplemental" PHC statement reads:"It is the position of New West Energy that all customers, both bundled service customers and direct access customers, are equally responsible for payment of the net undercollections.  Fairness dictates that bundled customers and direct access customers are both assessed their fair share of the responsibility for repaying the amount of the net undercollections as may be determined by the Commission."Obviously, not a helpful statement.  New West's supplemental PHC statement is attached.Best,Jeff

ek@a-klaw.com,ek@a-klaw.com,ek@a-klaw.com,Subject: Meeting w/PG&E this Friday, Right after DJ's Meeting,Hi Evie:As you know Edison is being, well, Edison about just about everything at the PUC.  I think that we actually have some leverage with PG&E, however.  I've helped to broker a meeting between large customers and PG&E (Tom Botorff and Dan Richard) this Friday at 1:30 PM after DJ's meeting.  DJ and Delainey are organizing The (basic) idea is to see if there is some way to strike a "reasonable" deal on the DA/cost allocation issues with PG&E, which could then be submitted to PUC around Edison, which seems hell bent on piling as many costs on business customers as possible. At the first meeting, we want to spend a very brief amount of time determining 1) what matters to people 2) where people on the issues and 3) PG&E's willingness to deal.  The goal is to find out if there's any room for a deal.  Should not take a long time. I hope you can attend, since the meeting will be significantly less productive if you're not there, and who knows, it may lead to something that permits us to go around Edison.  Likely attendees are CMTA, CLECA, the Chamber, you (hopefully), PG&E and me.  Will Mike Kahl be at DJ's meeting? Best,Jeff

ddr0@pge.com,ddr0@pge.com,ddr0@pge.com,Subject: Peaker Facility We Discussed Last Week,Dan:  I wanted to follow up on our discussion last week regarding the peaker we're helping Lodi to develop.The project is a peaker plant inside Lodi's territory, with the power sold to DWR.The deal is both price and time sensitive (no surprise there).  Needs to be on line Q3/Q4, 2002, at a price that's in line with price negotiated with DWR.For the gas interconnect, your folks tell us that the project requires $8-$11 MM in system upgrades that will take 14-16 months to complete.By contrast, the project could connect directly to Lodi's gas storage facility for about $2.6 MM and could be completed in about 4-6 months.In short, PG&E's offers blows through both the time and price constraints; the Lodi option accommodates both very well.We are very senstive to the tariff revenues you would forgo via a direct connect to Lodi and potential concerns regarding precedent over connecting directly to the storage facility.Therefore, 1) we'd be willing to pay the local distribution tariff price, irrespective of being connected directly to the Lodi facility, 2) we'd be willing to switch over and connect with PG&E once the upgrades in the Lodi/Stockton area are done, and 3) we'd agree that the direct connection with Lodi should be viewed as a "special case" (and not precendent) with the goal of avoiding exacerbating California's problems with supply shortages.Thanks for listening. Let me know what you think.Best,Jeff

Yet by most accounts, Californians have already paid off the utilties' stranded costs.  How many times must Californians pay? 	We worked with consumer and business 	groups to oppose the bill.2)	In the "alternative MOU" that Rod worked on with Republicans, the Replicans told us that Rod insisted on suspending Direct 	Access until January 1, 2003--a demand that most believe originated with Edison.3)	Rod sponsored a bill two years ago that would prevent any market participant other than the utilities to provide metering and 	billing services.  Today, this issue is less important to us, but it was very important to us at the time, and Rod remained 	unswervingly in the utilities' camp, despite our efforts.Hope this helps.  If you need any other information, just let me know.  Best,Jeff

Our market-tested and accepted products and services allow your customers to better manage costs, reduce operational and financial risks and focus on their core business activitiesOur alliance partners do not take on any price risk related to these products.Products and services customization further enable our alliance partners to spur economic development and maintain customer retention.Innovative financial solutions that allow companies to upgrade industrial facilities and energy infrastructure, including energy consuming equipment and demand-side management programs, without diverting capital from their core businesses.

You should feel free to share with the business folks but under the condition that they keep it confidential.  And of course, we'd be thrilled if they'd sign on.  If you have any questions, just holler.Best,JeffThe primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are as follows: The Decision violates procedural due process guarantees. The failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 1708.5(f). The Commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process. The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commission's authority. The Commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority. The Decision's purported findings are not supported. The Commission has impermissibly converted a ratemaking proceeding into a quasi-legislative proceeding.

Please forgive me for not getting back to you more promptly.  Here's the latest:As you know, I'm finishing up my MBA at Berkelely (I'll have but one class left to take next semester!).  Finals/projects, etc. are all done/due, etc. next week, so as you can imagine it's very crazy.In addition, I (we) had to put the sweetest dog in the world to sleep this week, and the Enron thing's been nothing compared to that.(I'd ask, "what next?", but I'm afraid to ask.....)However, none of this constitutes an excuse for not getting back to you, so I apologize.OK, back to Enron.It's a mess (surprise).I'm still with the company--not sure for how long, however.  At least through the end of the year, it appears.Sue and Joseph have left.  If you'd like their contact information, I'd be happy to provide it.We're trying to transfer our DA contracts to other ESPs, but the utilities, Carl Wood and some others want to make it difficult, if not impossible.Though difficult as it may seem to believe, I'm actually doing OK (engaging in lots of zen buddist stuff) and I do promise to give each of you a ring to catch up very soon.This week's a little tough just because with school and "the mess," I'm a tad preoccupied.HOWEVER, your calls and nice thoughts are extremely welcomed and greatly appreciated.  Thanks so much.Will talk to you soon and hope you're doing well.Best,Jeff

Second, in line with the "role play" that you described in class and in the handout for the project, we took your direction to heart and tried to make our presentation slides very free of jargon, spreadsheets, reams of numbers, etc..  Given the end-of-semester work load, we, like everyone else, are very appreciative that we will only have to turn in the presentation and the spreadsheet for the project.  Given the change, if you would like, we would be happy to "beef up" the presentation to include more numbers, jargon and other technical gems, though the spreadsheet lays out most of that information pretty well.  Whichever way you prefer is fine by us.  Just let me know.Best,Jeff

I've written her an email, telling her that we followed directions closely on the presentation (i.e., very simply, no jargon, spreadsheets, lots of technical crap, etc.) and wanted to make sure that that would acceptably when we turn it in, or  if she expected some "beefing up."I plant to spend a little time with my slides and the spreadsheet (though not much!), just to make a bit better.

Alan's got an airplane ticket to go down and attend the lobbyist meeting.  From my perspective, there is very little value in that activity.  However, if Scott wanted to go and report back, then a) he gets information which likely doesn't hurt their business and b) the "Estate" doesn't incur the cost of Alan traveling to Sacramento to a meeting that likely won't have a huge amount of value.  But if Scott ain't interested, he ain't interested.  That's my take.  Best,Jeff

richard.shapiro@enron.com,richard.shapiro@enron.com,richard.shapiro@enron.com,Subject: RE: Conference Call Advisory for SUNDAY, September 9th,I'm starting to get concerned about this.  A) I didn't pick the time.  B) I talked to Sue on Friday and she will be out of Church at 10 AM PDT and on the call shortly thereafter. Sue seemed more concerned about having a call at all then on the time.  If she expressed a view that the time was set up so that she couldn't be on the call, I'd like to discuss, since that didn't factor in at all.As you know, having gone through Sandi, I'm extremely sensitive to inter-group relations.  If you feel there are issues that we should discuss, I'd really like to do it.  I react very strongly to any view that I am intentionally doing anything to get in Sue's---or others---way.  From my perspective, I feel strongly that I haven't behaved that way, and don't in any way intend to.  I simply have no desire to "compete" with colleagues, Sue in particular.  There aren't enough people to do all the work, and there's plenty of tasks, recognition, blame, etc. to go around.These are extremely challenging times and we won't get anywhere unless it's truly a team effort.  I know that the SF office has a history of challenges with respect to California leadership. I have no interest in returning to the very un-teamlike atmosphere that existed previously, particularly since the atmosphere has changed so positively in the past few months.  For a variety of reasons, I have been asked to take on alot of tasks over the past year. I've tried very hard to perform well, while at the same time working hard with Paul and Sue to advance a significantly more healthy, inclusive, open and collegial working environment in California and the West.

The sale -- coming in an environment of record-low interest rates -- also proved to be the cheapest such short-term financing by the state on record. And it provided a backdrop for a warning from state Treasurer Phil Angelides that continued delay in the long-awaited $12.5 billion energy-bond sale could wreak havoc with the state's budget in the next fiscal year. With the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks delivering a blow to an already shaky economy, there is concern that state revenues may drop even more precipitously than they have in the past year, leading to a crunch for the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2002. The slower state revenues coupled with increased expenditures and the added burdens of the ongoing energy crisis, could force "Draconian" budget cuts, Angelides said. "We were already facing tough budget times in 2002-2003," he said, "and that was before the tragedy of Sept. 11." Now, if falling revenues are added to the "$6 billion hole, we'll have deficits akin to the early 1990s," Angelides said, noting the dramatic effects would be on people who depend on state services. Earlier this year, the state advanced $6.2 billion in general-fund money to buy wholesale power for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. Repayment to the state general fund depends on successful sale of the $12.5 billion in energy bonds -- a transaction Angelides said requires key approvals from the state Public Utilities Commission. The huge energy-bond sale initially was proposed for this summer and then moved to late October or early November. But the plan before the PUC has drawn heavy opposition from state utilities. With utilities and others threatening lawsuits at every step of the way, regulators have needed time to build a legal record for each of the seven decisions the treasurer seeks, PUC President Loretta Lynch said Tuesday. This year, "we've been taken to court probably five times more than we've been taken to court last year," partly because the commission has been making historic decisions and partly because it's been trying to make them so fast, she said. But Angelides said that given the delay in PUC action, he is doubtful an energy-bond sale can occur before 2002. Besides raising the budget concerns, that also could mean that California misses an opportunity to capitalize on the very low interest rate environment. "I do not see a way now that this bond issue can happen this year," he said, citing the minimum 60 days of public notices and appeal periods that would follow PUC action. Tuesday's bond sale to meet the state's cash-flow needs involved what are known as revenue anticipation notes. The notes are fixtures on California's cash-flow landscape. In 1993-94, for example, the state sold $8 billion through multiple offerings. No such sale was held last year because the state had an adequate surplus. But a year earlier, in fiscal 1999-2000, $1 billion in notes were sold to meet cash-flow needs. Besides being the largest municipal-bond sale on record, Tuesday's sale was also the largest muni- and corporate-bond issuance since the terrorist strikes. Tuesday's debt issuance was viewed widely as a success because the vast majority of the securities found buyers. "It speaks to overall quality of the state's credit and the way the state is perceived, particularly in light of Sept. 11," said Peter Taylor, senior vice president in the Los Angeles office of Lehman Bros. As senior manager on the sale, Taylor and Lehman Bros. coordinated participation of more than 20 investment-banking firms. "There was wide acceptance from a range of investors, retail (buyers), mom-and-pop buyers all the way to mutual funds and corporations," Taylor said. The level of orders exceeded the offering by more than $2 billion. That allowed yields to be lowered through negotiations from the 2.25 level initially proffered to the lowest RAN on record in the state, an annualized 2.22 percent. The notes mature June 28, 2002. Overall yield, counting the variable-rate portion of the issuance, is only 2.17 percent. Had the $6.2 billion in general-fund money been repaid, Angelides said, the need for Tuesday's short-term debt issuance "would have been substantially less ... if not eliminated." Even so, Angelides said the state was fortunate to "move into the market and get extraordinary interest rates, and we will be able to make it through this fiscal year."

To say that it would not be a problem for very large tranches of customers to leave the system as part of "community aggregation,"  and then say it WOULD be a problem for individual customers to do the same, is, well, ridiculous.  In short, if you can work out the terms and conditions under which potentially huge tranches can go DA, then it is certainly feasible to do the same thing for individual customers. Finally, we're checking, but it seems that it will be be extremely difficult to say that its legally kosher for the PUC to permit DA under 9X, but suspend all other DA.  Very interesting.Best,Jeff

Gray Davis and his board picks for the California PUC, which, the paper asserts, have nullified the only good to come out of California's energy deregulation - consumer choice. With commentary from Lance Izumi, an electricity policy analyst at the Pacific Research Institute, the Register says a PUC policy that requires customers to buy power from their local utility company is forcing ratepayers to fund Davis's overpriced energy purchases.     The negative impact on California businesses, some already in a slump, could force the state's economy into a recession and discourage businesses from relocating there, the editorial said. It's reminiscent of the 1990's when government policy caused an economic bust and state unemployment shot to 10% (Orange County Register via Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service, Sept. 25, http://www.ocregister.com ).

September 26, 2001 By KIMBERLY KINDYThe Orange County Register SACRAMENTOA state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California's energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices. The investigative committee, headed by state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol: "the palace coup." Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers. The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter, the president of the Independent System Operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge. Winter defied his own board and Gov. Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show. "I don't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort," said Dunn. The subpoenas will force those involved, including Winter, to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee, and to turn over e-mails, personal calendars and memos. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt "betrayed" by the actions of Winter. "The governor believes it was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis," Maviglio said. Winter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office. ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn's committee will find no criminal conduct. The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind: to keep the lights on. At the time, generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps. "It was an emergency," Fishman said. "We had to take action.'' What became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power. The restrictions would drive prices as low as $65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier. "They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much," said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March. "All hell broke loose.'' Records show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed. The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators. "If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III. Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials. He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "fix" prices, which would violate federal trade laws. In the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market. The generators got their way. The next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan. What was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier. Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they couldn't make a profit even under these constraints. They began to withhold power from California, and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted. What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis. Winter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO, submitted a 50-page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the $250 price cap. Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government. Neither the ISO board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of Winter's actions until the cap had been removed. In fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, Charles Robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made. He didn't mention anything about it. "In retrospect, we should have told them,'' Robinson said. With the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs. "The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor's key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,'' Maviglio said. "It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant. This action accelerated the utilities' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business." Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $249 a megawatt to $700 a megawatt within three days, ISO records show. Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $30 billion. Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians. Prices, he said, did not spike as a result. Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity. Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials. "We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,'' Robinson said. "In our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation. We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund." Jan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap. Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted. "Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers. "He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing." The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions. Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said. James J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter. "They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said. "They (ISO management) did what any independent system operator would do." What Dunn's committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired. He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winter's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues. "We don't know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out," Dunn said. "Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians, but I find that argument has no basis in fact.''

More than 6,000 firms, including big retail chains and industrial plants, signed discounted power contracts in July and August as market prices dropped. State officials are incensed, saying the private "direct access" contracts with electricity providers could shift the burden for millions of dollars in state power purchases onto households and small businesses. State Treasurer Phil Angelides said the same companies that benefited as the state depleted its budget surplus to keep the lights on now want to escape paying their share of the billions spent to ensure power supplies for California. "I think it's wrong and it's immoral," Angelides said. State officials argue that the summer contracts can still be canceled retroactively because California businesses were on notice that their option to shop around for better deals on electricity was about to be suspended by the state Public Utilities Commission. The PUC is set to consider the retroactive ban Thursday. But energy firms say the summer deals were perfectly legal because the PUC had not yet taken action and made a series of draft decisions that put off the effective date of the direct access ban until as late as yesterday. "The drafts were not consistent," said Tracy Fairchild, a spokeswoman for Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, a consortium of generators and energy suppliers. "Which one were we supposed to take seriously?" The energy trade group is threatening to sue to protect the summer contracts. Angelides fears that a prolonged court fight could block a $12.5 billion state bond sale to reimburse the treasury for California's emergency power purchases. The burgeoning conflict is part of a continuing fight by energy firms and some of their business customers to preserve direct access -- a core provision of the state's 1996 deregulation law. Deregulation supporters predicted energy consumers would enjoy lower prices if private generators were allowed to compete with the utilities as power suppliers. But the direct access program was thrown into disarray last year when wholesale electricity prices skyrocketed and the state stepped in to buy power. To make sure the state's outlay would be paid back by all ratepayers, the Legislature in January directed the PUC to suspend direct access. By that time, most direct access customers were fleeing back to the utilities to benefit from a rate cap that protected them from the soaring market power prices. The PUC postponed action on the direct access ban while some legislators were sponsoring bills that would have allowed the program to continue under certain conditions. But by July, market prices had come down, and energy providers like Enron Energy Services, AES New Energy and Strategic Energy were again offering direct access contracts. Businesses were looking for relief from the record rate hikes imposed on utility customers in June, said Phoenix energy consultant Gina Coleman. Coleman said she helped five retail chains with "a significant number" of stores in California negotiate contracts with Strategic Energy this summer. "Business is business, and if you can get a better price for something, you should," said Coleman, who declined to name her clients. She said the lower costs will help the stores keep doing business in California and hold their prices down. Daniel Douglass, an attorney for the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, said any attempt by the state to cancel contracts retroactively would violate the constitutional law. He said energy firms have purchased power to serve their customers under the contracts and would suffer losses if they were canceled. Angelides said the same firms that ran to the state for protection when their market contracts became too expensive now want to take advantage of lower power prices he attributes to the stabilizing effect of the state's long- term power contracts. "You can't take advantage of the state's stabilizing the rates, then say, 'Thank you very much,' and stick everyone else with the bill," Angelides said. State officials have not tallied the total number of customers who signed up in July and August, nor have they estimated the revenue loss that would have to be covered by remaining utility ratepayers. Figures compiled by the PUC show that commercial and industrial firms signed more than 6,000 new direct access contracts in July alone. A rough calculation suggests that, as a result, the firms might contribute as much as $64 million less annually to the repayment of state costs. The loss might not be significant enough to risk a court fight that would delay the bond sale, state officials said. Bu Angelides said the same power firms that helped create the energy crisis by charging exorbitant rates are now threatening a bond issue desperately needed to restore funds needed for education, health care and children's services. "What they're talking about doing," he said, "is holding us hostage until they get what they want."

Latest word is that Assembly, Senate and Administration staff have been locked in a room with orders not to emerge until they've struck a deal on the Edison MOU.  Word on DA is not good.  Thus far it appears that the PUC "study" outlined in the letter from Burton & Co. to Lynch is as far as the Senate wants to go at this time, but folks continue to push.  Seems to be a possibility that, if the Legislature does reconvene, there may be a push by "green Senators" to pass a "green only" DA bill.In addition, Lynch is setting the stage to have the PUC reject the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC on Tuesday.  This despite the Governor calling to vigorously lobby each of the commissioners.  Despite the strong arm tactics, it appears that Brown may be the only aye vote at this point.The idea is that, if the PUC votes down the rate agreement, the only thing Davis will have left is 18XX.  We'll report back with news as we get it.Best,Jeff

Gray Davis survived the summer without the widespread power blackouts his opponents predicted, but voters remained dissatisfied with his job performance and disinclined to re-elect him, a Field Poll released Tuesday found. The poll showed Davis narrowly behind in a trial general election matchup against former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, 45 percent to 42 percent. Riordan's strength in Los Angeles County -- rare for a Republican candidate -- as well as lingering damage to Davis from California's energy crisis were factors in the findings, said the poll's managing director, Mark DiCamillo. "It's an interesting situation for a sitting governor," he said. "It's very unusual for a sitting governor to be denied re-election, but here we have a unique candidate coming out of a Democratic stronghold. And also we have this issue that is kind of hanging around the neck of the governor that the public is not very pleased about, and that's the energy and the electricity crisis." In a hypothetical Republican primary, Riordan led by a large margin over Secretary of State Bill Jones, 46 percent to 19 percent. Businessman Bill Simon trailed with 5 percent of the vote, while 30 percent was undecided. The poll surveyed 1,003 Californians, including 722 registered voters, Sept. 7-10 and is subject to an overall error margin of 3.2 percent. Davis political adviser Garry South said reporting poll results taken before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast was "horribly misleading." "These kinds of watershed events that shake the national psyche always have an effect on job approval," he said. "These kinds of things have effects on the way people feel about incumbents in general." DiCamillo said he found it notable, however, that views of Davis' performance continued to lag even as voters worried less about the electricity crisis. In May, at the peak of concern about potential power blackouts, voters said they disapproved of Davis' performance, 49 percent to 42 percent. In the latest survey, they continued to disapprove, 47 percent to 41 percent. Voters also said they were not inclined to re-elect Davis, 50 percent to 43 percent. "Now we're in a situation where the energy crisis mentality has receded, yet the public's image of the governor has not changed," DiCamillo said. "He has not benefited from the easing of public concern about the issue and is in the same situation that he found himself back in May. "No matter what the political temper of the times internationally, there will be issues that are particular to the governor's race. This issue is what the public has focused their attention on in evaluating Davis, and it's still negative." DiCamillo said he also was struck by the fact that the poll found Riordan leading among voters in Los Angeles County, 47 percent to 43 percent. He said the survey showed similar results in May. Los Angeles County accounts for one-quarter of the state's electorate, and Democrats typically carry it and the Bay Area by large margins, making up for losses in virtually every other area of the state. Riordan adviser Dan Schnur said the numbers pose a strategic difficulty for Davis. "It's clear from this poll result that the voters who know Dick Riordan best support him most," he said. "Unless Gray Davis plans on winning the Bay Area by a voice vote, there's no way he can get re-elected unless he turns L.A. County around in a very big way." South said Riordan, who held a nonpartisan office in Los Angeles, will fare far differently in a statewide partisan contest. And he recalled that then-Gov. Pete Wilson was trailing Democrat Kathleen Brown by 23 points as he prepared in 1993 for re-election. "We all know how that turned out," he said. "A sitting California governor hasn't been defeated for a second term since 1942." The Bee's Amy Chance can be reached at (916) 326-5535 or achance@sacbee.com <mailto:achance@sacbee.com>.

Angelides is trying to turn the screws on Loretta.*********************************************************************Calif. power bond delay may lead to large deficit NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - California state Treasurer Philip Angelides said Thursday the state could face a $9.3 billion budget deficit in the 2002-2003 fiscal year if $12.5 billion of power bonds are not sold before July 2002. The treasurer is certain the bonds will be sold, but he released the figures in an attempt to pressure the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) into actions it must take in order to sell the bonds. "What I am concerned about is the fact this law has not been effectuated eight months after it was passed," Angelides said in a telephone news conference in Sacramento, referring to a law passed in February setting the biggest municipal bond sale ever in motion. The state depleted its general fund by at least $6.2 billion buying electricity to keep power flowing and must sell the bonds in order to refill the state's general fund and make future power purchases. "There can be no schedule (for the bond sale) until the PUC completes its work," Angelides said. Earlier this week the PUC said the much-delayed meeting is now set for Oct. 2. Angelides said PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown, one of five, is on board to make the vote, but President Loretta Lynch and other commissioners, "are not ready to act." Lynch said earlier this week that she wants more time to work out details with Angelides and the Department of Water Resources concerning the money and terms of the rate order and rate agreement. How the money from rate increases approved in May will be split up to pay for the bonds and to reimburse troubled power utilities and giving the Department of Water Resources the authority to sell the bonds, still need to be decided by the PUC. Angelides is projecting a $3.1 billion budget deficit for the 2002-2003 fiscal year, even if the bonds are sold in time, due to reduced revenues as the overall U.S. economy slows. In a worst case scenario, Angelides added that with the bond sale, the $3.1 billion gap may grow to $4 billion, while a late sale would push the $9.3 billion number to $10.2 billion. The treasurer painted a dire picture of California 's budget if the bonds are not sold, likening it to the state's budget problems of the early 1990s. Angelides warned a 2 percent sales tax increase might have to be put in place, or possibly a $1,574 per student cut in state K-12 education spending. Or, the state could drop all spending on the University of California and California State University and save $6 billion. Eighteen percent of the state's non-education budget would need to be cut if the bonds are not sold, he said.

Marois Sacramento, California, Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A special legislative session to consider a rescue package for Edison International's insolvent California utility won't begin until Oct 9., aides for Governor Gray Davis said. The governor had been expected to call lawmakers back Oct. 2. His aides didn't explain the reasons for the delay. The governor plans to make an announcement at 3 p.m. San Francisco time, Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said. Southern California Edison, California's second-largest utility, accrued $3.9 billion in debt under the state's deregulation law, which froze consumer rates and let wholesale power costs rise. Some of the utility's creditors are trying to put together a group of three to force the company into bankruptcy. PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, filed for bankruptcy in April. The Legislature adjourned Sept. 15 without approving a $2.9 billion rescue package, prompting Davis to announce he would call lawmakers back to Sacramento to consider a new plan. The latest Edison measure may let the utility sell $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion in bonds to pay off its debt, secured by existing rates on about 20 percent of its largest commercial customers, Davis aides said last week.

Extraordinary (Special) Session Rules and ProceduresCall of Special Session: Only the Governor has the authority to convene a special session of the Legislature. In convening the session, the Governor must issue a proclamation outlining the reasons for the special session, and only issues specified in the proclamation may be acted upon. Election of Special Session Officers, Committees and Bill Referrals: The election of officers and the appointment of special session committees are separate from the Legislature's regular session. In some instances, special session committees are comprised of different committee members than those appointed to regular session committees. Identification of Special Session Bills and Publications: Separate record-keeping publications (File, History, Journal and Roll Call) are printed for each individual extraordinary session. Special session bills are identified by specific paper colors (i.e. blue or green). For example, documents in the 2001 Second Extraordinary Session are printed on green paper. Introduction of Special Session Bills: There is no limit to the number of bills that a member of the Legislature may introduce during the extraordinary session, and none of the bills introduced during the extraordinary session count toward the member's bill limit in the Regular Session. Special Session Bill Procedures and Calendars: There is no bill introduction deadline during special sessions, and the "30-day in print" rule and committee file notice requirements do not apply. Special session bills also are not subject to the regular legislative session calendar, committee and/or floor deadlines. The sine die deadline requiring session to adjourn on November 30 of the second year of a legislative session does apply to the Special Session. Effective Date of Special Session Legislation: Simple majority vote special session bills take effect on the 91st day after the special session is adjourned. Urgency measures and other two-thirds majority-vote bills take effect immediately upon the Governor's signature. The Governor has 12 days from the date it is received on his desk to sign or veto legislation. Similar to the Regular Session, a special session bill may become law without the Governor's signature. End of Special Session: Only the Legislature, by concurrent resolution, may end a special session. The concurrent resolution takes effect upon passage by both houses of the Legislature, and is not subject to a Governor's signature or veto.

For example, the Legislature could pass a bill directing the PUC how to allocate costs associated with the utilties' undercollection, the bonds issued to recover general fund money used to purchase power, DWR's long term contracts, etc. Best,Jeff  1.

Immediate renegotiation is urged.By VIRGINIA ELLIS and NANCY VOGELTimes Staff WritersSeptember 30 2001SACRAMENTO -- At least eight of the long-term contracts to buy electricity that California officials signed this year are so egregious that they should immediately be renegotiated, according to a new, detailed study. The biggest problems are so-called "take or pay" clauses that require the state to buy large quantities of expensive power even if there is no demand for it, the study said. The contracts will saddle Californians with high electricity rates for the next decade because the state negotiated many deals that require the purchase of too much energy at too high a price, according to the analysis, which was sponsored by a coalition of consumer, environmental and renewable energy groups. Between January and September, the state Department of Water Resources entered into 53 agreements to buy electricity for customers of the state's three investor-owned utilities, which have been unable to buy power on their own. The longest of the contracts would last 20 years, and overall, the pacts are estimated to cost $43 billion over the next two decades. Power generators did not rule out the possibility of renegotiating at least some contracts, but said any move to do so would have to be requested by the state. "If we receive a request and it makes sense for both parties to restructure the contracts, we will consider it," said Joe Ronan, a senior vice president for San Jose-based Calpine Corp. But, he said, the company has "no intention of asking for renegotiation" on its own. Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade association for electricity generating companies, said other members of his group might also consider renegotiation. So far, he said, "I don't see any realistic legislative or regulatory efforts to push it in that direction." And he said the producers would oppose any efforts to force them back to the bargaining table. "We'd take strong exception to involuntary renegotiations," he said. For his part, Gov. Gray Davis would be open to renegotiations, said his spokesman, Steve Maviglio, but only if power generators show a willingness to return to the bargaining table. "Would we love to get a better deal?" Maviglio said. "Of course we would, but the contracts we negotiated helped us get in the positive position we are in now, and if the generators were willing to renegotiate the contracts, we'd be the first ones at the table." S. David Freeman, who led the contract talks last winter on behalf of the state, said critics miss the larger purpose of the agreements. When the state began negotiating contracts, California had just suffered two days of rotating blackouts. The contracts tamed the market and eliminated the blackout threat, he said. "Insurance is insurance, and it costs a little bit," said Freeman, "but it's a good thing to have." But William B. Marcus, chief economist for JBS Energy, which conducted the three-month study, noted that at least one of the most troublesome agreements was signed in July--weeks after the market had stabilized and prices had declined. The study of the contracts was sponsored by the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies and was financed by a $200,000 grant from the San Francisco-based Energy Foundation. It was conducted by JBS, a consulting group. The study singled out for criticism: * A deal with Sempra Energy, parent company to San Diego Gas & Electric, which Marcus called the most expensive and inflexible of all the contracts. Over the life of the pact, he calculated, Sempra would earn $1.2 billion more than the California Energy Commission estimates unregulated power should cost. The contract lasts until 2011. For each year, it requires the state to buy large amounts of power at fixed prices whether it's needed or not. * A deal to buy electricity from small Northern California power plants owned by Calpine Co. that have yet to be built. The plants will be "peakers," designed to run in short bursts when electricity supplies are tight, such as on hot summer afternoons. The state agreed to pay Calpine $90 million a year for five years simply for the right to buy 495 megawatts of electricity. "They get $90 million a year on plants that cost $250 million," said Marcus. "That's huge. You get your money out in three years. If a utility had built these power plants, they would have charged half as much." * A deal with Alliance-Colton LLC to buy the output of two inefficient peaker power plants in San Bernardino County. The deal commits the state to pay $207 million through 2010 whether or not it uses any of the 72 megawatts of electricity. * An agreement to pay $150 per megawatt-hour for two years--more than twice the average price of $69 per megawatt-hour of all the contracts--for power from several aging plants that Mirant Corp. of Atlanta owns in the San Francisco Bay Area. * A contract the state signed in July to buy power from Pacificorp, a private utility based in Portland, Ore. Pacificorp agreed to sell electricity at a fixed price of $70 per megawatt-hour. That price could have looked reasonable at the height of last winter's crisis, but it was double what energy sold for when the contract was signed. * Contracts with two power marketing companies for electricity generated by the same Southern California plants. The difference in price shows what a poor deal the state got under one of the contracts, the study said. One of the marketers, Allegheny Energy Supply Co., agreed to sell from 150 to 1,000 megawatts from March 2001 to December 2011 for a straight $61 per megawatt-hour. But a second marketer, Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co. got a nine-year contract to sell from 35 to 600 megawatts from the same plants for $62.50 to $87 per megawatt-hour. "When you compare those two contracts," Marcus said, "you know you've got a dog here. I think Williams showed up earlier, and the state was desperate." * An agreement with Dynegy Corp. of Houston that requires the state to pay for emissions credits and upgrading of pollution control equipment on the firm's California-based plants. The contract puts no ceiling on those costs, Marcus said, and it is unclear how high they are likely to go. * A pact to buy electricity from a plant being built in Victorville by a partnership between Inland Energy of Newport Beach and Constellation Power Development of Baltimore. The state agreed to a price of $58 per megawatt-hour, but is obligated to take all of the power, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Marcus, a Harvard-trained economist who has 23 years of experience with electricity and gas utility issues, said the brunt of the financial pain from the contracts will not be felt by consumers until after the next election, when the pacts significantly increase the amount of power the state buys. He said 96% of all the electricity purchased under the contracts becomes available--much of it on a take or pay basis--after next summer. Those large power buys will come when the state is expected to have energy surpluses because of increasing supply and a decline in demand driven by higher prices. "The state has agreed to buy too much power, often for too long a period, at too high a price, and much of this power is simply too dirty," said V. John White, executive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies. "To make matters worse, almost all of these contracts are dependent on one price-volatile fuel: natural gas." When the state began negotiating contracts in January, electricity prices averaged $177 per megawatt-hour and sometimes spiked higher than $1,000 per megawatt-hour. By June, the average price had fallen below $100. Lately, prices hover around $30 per megawatt-hour, similar to the cost California enjoyed before prices went haywire. Marcus was particularly critical of one element of the Pacificorp contract: a clause that prevents the state from taking advantage of the plummeting price of natural gas until after 2003. The price of natural gas, the main fuel used to run power plants in California, began to jump last fall but has plummeted since spring. Another weakness of the contracts, Marcus said, is that they lock the state into further dependence on gas. For the prices California will pay under these pacts, residents could have made a greater investment in power generated by the sun, wind or other renewable sources for the same price or cheaper, he said. Windmills and solar panels would help buffer against natural gas price spikes, he said. Renewable sources of power also don't release air pollution and gases that contribute to global warming, he added. "I'm paying to buy something that really isn't the right thing to buy," Marcus said. "I don't want to pay Williams $69 a megawatt-hour to generate lots of inefficient gas-fired power that I have to take that's going to increase global warming and increase pollution in the South Coast Air Basin."

"I don't want to pay Williams $69 a megawatt-hour to generate lots of inefficient gas-fired power that I have to take that's going to increase global warming and increase pollution in the South Coast Air Basin."

Thanks.Best,JeffState PUC seeks to void Davis's power contracts Deals gouge consumers, agency tells federal regulators In a move that could undermine California's hard-won control of the power market, state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov. Gray Davis. The state Public Utilities Commission, in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governor's power strategy, is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians. The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the state's power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices, and it wants some of those prices cut. "The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if they're not renegotiated," Commissioner Richard Bilas said. "I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down." The PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. "It's definitely not something that's a favorable thing to have happen to us," said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which negotiated the contracts. Hidalgo said the long-term contracts, even though more expensive than current market prices, are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices. "It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out," Hidalgo said. "If that's the goal, then we're back to square one. Prices would start to creep up." The state is paying an average of $69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators. Peak prices for electricity last week were less than $30. Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned $12.5 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases. Over the past three months, lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp. subsidiary, said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher. SEMPRA, CALPINE CONTRACTSTaken together, Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements, some of which last 20 years. In all, California has committed to spending at least $43 billion for electricity. The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the $1 billion contract, one of Davis' energy consultants owned stock in the power supplier's parent company. Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts. Davis' spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldn't comment until it had studied the PUC submissions. The PUC's challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission, which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governor's three appointees. The commission has rebuffed Davis' attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned $12.5 billion bond issue. STATE TREASURER'S WARNINGState Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUC's actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a $9 billion hole in the state budget next year. PUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer. "We should not, through the instrument of the bonds, lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years," Lynch said last week. "We should stay as flexible as possible. Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commission's challenges to the contracts. Commissioner Jeff Brown, Lynch's fellow Davis appointee, said the filings don't rule out Davis' bond financing deal. Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts, he said. But federal action could help the state improve the deals, he said. "The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract," he said. "Even if we renegotiate, we'll renegotiate within the confines of the contract." Hidalgo, however, said he doubted the state could modify the contracts. Under power granted by the Legislature, he said, the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable. Jan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for ScottishPower, parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing, said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations. "Now another California agency is disputing it," Mitchell said. "We obviously disagree, and we'll continue to work with FERC, making sure the contracts are honored." PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGSThe PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year, $1 billion deal with the company July 6. That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts, the PUC says. "News reports suggest that the (water department) paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract, prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers," the PUC said. An energy consultant to Davis, Vikram Budhraja, admitted in August that he owned as much as $10,000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out. Budhraja sold the stock July 30, and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal. Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the state's energy picture. While the issue has slipped from the public eye, Davis' solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate, which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edison's finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing. While officials fight among themselves, the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation. ***************************************************

The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companiesWe believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws," said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. "If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void." Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=WMB>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=WMB>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=WMB>) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed. "It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract," Ahern said. "It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover." The groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=AYE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=AYE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=AYE>) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SPI>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SPI>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SPI>) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SRE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE>) and Calpine Corp.

Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report.

However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:Some agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals.Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals.Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.Any comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison's proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.Best,Jeff

"We are pleased that this proposal would allow PG&E to pay the tens of thousands of small businesses who are owed money -- in full, with interest. These firms, through no fault of their own, have been hurt by this energy crisis, and should be made whole -- and will be, under this proposal." "We are particularly pleased that PG&E's plan does not include any kind of rate increase. With our economy hanging in the balance, the last thing California consumers or small businesses need is higher utility rates. The plan also will provide consumers with power pricing stability -- by locking in long-term prices for power at a relatively low price. This will benefit all customers by establishing fair prices that won't spike over time." "Finally, it is critically important to note that the plan is designed to return PG&E to financial viability so that the State of California can get out of the power procurement business, which has been taking funds away from other economic and social programs. The plan also does not require any legislative action or any financial bailout, so the State's attention and funds may once again be focused on their appropriate objectives." The California Retailers Association is a trade association representing major California department and specialty stores, mass merchandisers, grocery, chain drug and convenience stores. Our members have more than 9,000 stores in California and account for more than $100 billion in sales annually.

If theCommission does not adjust rates according to DWR's estimated revenuecalculations, the Bond Trustee may enforce bondholders' rights to have ratesestablished at a level that satisfies DWR.? May require the Commission to require all utilities to take DWR's powerand deliver it to customers in their service territories before theutilities sell their own, often lower cost power to customers in eachservice territory. ? Precludes utilities from returning to the business of providing 100% oftheir customers' electricity needs for the life of the bonds because thestate must stay in the business of buying and selling power to meet therequirements of a net revenue bond.  Guarantees DWR receives whateverrevenue it needs for all of its power programs and establishes the State inthe power business for at least 15 years, the life of the bonds.  ? Because the bonds can be repaid only from DWR sales, suggests the need tochange the Legislatively imposed mandate that DWR's program "sunset" at theend of 2002.   Already, the financial community has expressed concern aboutthis provision.  In response, DWR's comments on the Rate Agreement suggestedthat an extension of the sunset by Executive Order could allow DWR tocontinue purchasing power in a way that would be funded throughCommission-approved revenue requirements.? Provides generators, who negotiated long-term contracts with the stateduring the very height of the energy crisis when market power was beingexercised, irrevocable 15-year assurances that those power purchase dealswill be treated as solidly as if they were loans from the generators to theState.? Interferes with Federal or other court efforts to review the long-termcontracts entered into by the state.  Because the existence of thosecontracts is essential to the continuation of the bond deal, the state wouldnot be able to take advantage of any change in circumstance or law thatwould reduce dependence on disadvantageous long-term contracts.? The Commission must also enforce rules so that utilities can bill andcollect on DWR's behalf, and customers are subject to disconnection forfailure to pay for electricity provided by DWR.? Constitutes irrevocable financing document - the Commission may not alteror modify any of its provisions without DWR's agreement.  DWR will likelyneed to obtain bondholder approval before agreeing to any changes.  Remainsin effect as long as the bonds are outstanding, regardless of how many bondsare issued.   The Challenges to the Rate Agreement? Eleven parties filed comments opposed to the Rate Agreement.? Received comments in support only from DWR, the office of the StateTreasurer, and the investment bank underwriting the bond transaction.? Received strong opposition citing numerous flaws with the rate agreement,including:	o The Commission cannot make the iron-clad guarantee to meet DWR'srevenue requirement 	o Unconstitutional, contrary to general principles of utilities law,and outside the scope of AB 1X, the statute that allows DWR to buy power  	o DWR has acted illegally and the Commission's actions are illegalbecause they rely on allegedly improper conduct on the part of DWROppose the requirement that the Commission must ensure that DWR has thephysical ability to stay in business using the utilities distributionnetworks.

The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companiesWe believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws," said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. "If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void." Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB, news, msgs) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed. "It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract," Ahern said. "It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover." The groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE, news, msgs) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI, news, msgs) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) and Calpine Corp. (CPN, news, msgs), according to the report. Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report.

This year's theme, "Explore, Inspire, Excel," is embodied by two exceptional keynote speakers: Donna Dubinsky, founder, president, and CEO of Handspring, and Beth Sawi, chief administrative officer and executive vice president of Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. The annual WIL conference is the longest-running student-run conference at Haas. Last year it attracted more than 400 participants including current MBA and undergraduate students, alumni, and career women from the greater Bay Area.Dubinsky gives the first keynote address of the day. She co-founded Handspring with Jeff Hawkins in July 1998 to create a new breed of hand-held computers for consumers. Before joining Handspring Dubinsky served as president and CEO of Palm Computing, where she helped make the Palm Pilot the best-selling hand-held computer and the most rapidly adopted new computing product ever produced. When Dubinsky first joined Hawkins at Palm Computing in 1992, shortly after the company was founded, she brought with her more than ten years of marketing and logistics experience from Apple and Claris. Dubinsky and Hawkins introduced the original Palm Pilot in February 1996, a move that revitalized the hand-held computing industry. She earned her BA from Yale University and her MBA from the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration.Beth Sawi oversees Human Resources, Corporate Communications, Community Affairs, Legal, Compliance, Internal Audit, and Corporate Services. She is also a member of the executive committee for The Charles Schwab Corporation. She will give the afternoon keynote address. Sawi is a long-time veteran of Schwab; she started her career at Schwab in 1982. From 1995 to 1997 she was executive vice president of Electronic Brokerage, during which time she headed Schwab's Internet launch. Sawi took a sabbatical in Italy in 1998-99 during which she wrote her book "Coming Up for Air: How to Build a Balanced Life in a Workaholic World," published by Hyperion in February 2000. She received a BA from Tufts University and an MBA from the Stanford University Graduate School of Business. Throughout the day, conference attendees will interact with leaders from a variety of professional backgrounds through the conference's panel sessions and workshops. Panels planned for this year's conference include: + Management Techniques to Inspire and Motivate + Women and the New Economy - Women in the Tech World + International Business + Wild Women This year's conference is sponsored by Fortune, Ford, Chevron, Genentech, J.P. Morgan, Johnson & Johnson, Accenture, Goldman Sachs, and Adobe.For more information on the WIL conference, please visit <http://www.wilconference.org/2001/index.html>.

We're as glad as anybody that it hasn't happened. I have a quick question:  Your consultant for gas procurement, a fellow named Mark Baldwin, until recently did some consulting work for one of our business units, Transwestern gas pipeline.  Mark has informed us that we won't be able to talk to him in his new role due to conflict of interest considerations that arise from our previous relationship with Mark.With that in mind, I was wondering if there is someone else working on gas procurement other than Mark (who doesn't face the same conflict issues) that we could meet with to discuss providing low-cost gas services to California?  We're very cognizant of the importance of maintaining a conflict-free environment.  But it would be a shame for the state to forego a good gas deal for the state's consumers.  If there's someone we can talk to and avoid (even the appearance of) conflict-of-interest, we'd be very anxious to do so.Thanks for your time and hope all is well.Best,Jeff

During the hearing, Senate Leader John Burton stated that:the Senate intends to rewrite the version of the MOU that the Assembly approved last Thursday night and sent over to the Senate for final approval (SB78).the version of the MOU that will emerge from the Senate sometime this week will look much more like the bill that originally passed out of the Senate prior to the July summer recess.  That bill was unacceptable to Edison and Davis, which led to the version that the Assembly developed and approved last Thursday night.If the Senate proceeds as Burton suggests, the chances are very low that an MOU will make it through the Legislature and get Davis' signature.Burton generally sticks to his word. But there is still time for additional negotiations and SB78 could squeak by. However, Burton's comments in the Rules Committee certainly don't help 78's chances for survival.Finally, the Assembly is currently debating the last surviving windfall profits bill, and the bill is having a hard time getting the votes necessary for passage.  More information on the windfall profits bill as we get it.Best,Jeff

The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.Given today's vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.Update on Edison BailoutStill appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another "special" session next Tuesday.If you have any questions, just let us know.Best,Jeff

This item was not on the Commission's agenda other than as a placeholder regarding "litigation."  We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edison's SVP of Regulatory Affairs and here's a summary:The Commission will keep current rates in place through 2003Any "overcollection" resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $3.3 B in Edison's past due accounts (the so-called "undercollection")If Edison collects the $3.3B prior to 2003, then rates can changeIf Edison has not collected the $3.3 B by the end of 2003, the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder.  Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005.Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $3.3 B undercollection.Edison can keep 10% of any refunds received after the $3.3B is paid off.Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $3.3B.Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk.Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs (i.e., if DWR's costs go up, the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edison's rates)The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edison's capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structureEdison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1) the "filed rate doctrine" and 2) the so-called "TURN" accounting method, which effectively kept the rate freeze in place.Edison agrees to "cooperate" with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers.The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the "special" session that the Governor recently announcedWe will report back with additional details as soon as we get them.Best,Jeff

The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers' costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state's role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time.  The terms of the Settlement Agreement include:?	Edison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt.  The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment.  The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month.  The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap.?	Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner.  If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in 2004.  Edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since Edison's annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, Edison's shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment.?	Edison will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt.  Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers.?	The PUC can direct Edison to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt. ?	The PUC agrees not to lower Edison's retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered.  However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs.?	The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if Edison's back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003. ?	There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities.?	Edison may make up to $900 million in capital expenditures annually."This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for Edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power, while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California," said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC.  "The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers."This agreement settles a November 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by Edison against the PUC, in which Edison claimed that the Commission's actions in not providing sufficient retail rates, violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property.  Under this agreement, Edison will release the PUC from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the Commission's decisions implementing AB 1X, AB 6X, and the TURN accounting proposal.

"We intend to pay all of our creditors," Bryson said Wednesday in a call with reporters. "But we do not have a specific date." Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission struck a deal Tuesday that will allow the utility to pay off $3.3 billion of its $3.9 billion debt through existing retail electricity rates. Both parties settled a year-old lawsuit Southern California Edison filed against the PUC--otherwise known as a filed rate doctrine--that could have ended a retail rate freeze and allowed the utility to recover more than $5 billion in wholesale power costs from ratepayers. The settlement must still be approved by a federal court judge. A ruling is expected by Thursday. Bryson indicated that the utility may try to negotiate with some large generators, owed nearly $1 billion, to accept less than 100 cents on the dollar for money the companies are owed. "There is no deal between us and the generators at this point," Bryson said. "We will engage promptly" in settlement discussions. "We are eager to work it out in a tough minded and fair way." Ted Craver, Edison's chief financial officer, said the utility has between $2.4 and $2.5 billion cash-on-hand and about $3.9 billion in debt. Bryson said the utility does not expect its credit ratings to be restored to investment grade "immediately." "We've had some discussions with the credit rating agencies," Bryson said. "But no one expects it to be restored immediately. It's going to take some time." Bryson added that the utility will seek new lending opportunites, but he did not elaborate.      Stephen Frank, president of Southern California Edison, said the utility would sit down with all of its creditors and work out a payment plan. Bryson said the utility believes that all of its debt can be paid off by the end of 2003. He did not say how much money from retail rates would be carved out for paying off Southern California Edison's debt. The utility's debt rose to $6.35 billion, according to a recent Securities and Exchange filing. "In the month of October we generated about $300 million" from retail rates. But Bryson said he could not estimate how much of that will be set aside to pay creditors. The utility and the PUC both said rates will not have to increase beyond the record rate hikes state regulators ordered earlier this year. Bryson said the utility has no intention of taking over the state's long-term power supply contracts as a result of the deal with the PUC.      Fearing the state legislature wouldn't support a bill to rescue Southern Califoria Edison after six months of wrangling, advisers to Gov. Gray Davis and Edison executives began negotiating with the state's Public Utilities Commission on a settlement of a year-old lawsuit the utility filed to force the commission to raise rates enough to cover its power costs. The negotiations with the PUC were kept secret from state lawmakers in case a settlement couldn't be reached, Davis aides and Edison executives said. The end result, Edison and the commission said, is a deal that will allow the utility to work out a plan to pay off its creditors and keep Southern California Edison from following PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy.

They didn't deregulate.  They just re-regulated the failed monopoly structure they'd been living with for decades.  Second, when the first mistake led to an energy crisis, California's leaders didn't stop, learn from their mistakes, and get deregulation right.  Instead, they blamed everyone but themselves, including Enron.  Those mistakes led to the nightmare California's been living for over a year now, and they still California still has woken up.""Enron's the model of the virtual organization.  Whether the problem's in California, or India or Sweden, Enron creates the virtual organization needed to solve the problem.  That's what we did in California.  Houston is definitely the brain, but you need all the other limbs and organs to function well.  What makes the "virtual" part of it work is a committed management team, great technology and an incredible team of talented, flexible folks from across the company.

This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. Or maybe not. While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. Duress allegedConsumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. "We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically," said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal." Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. "The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts," Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. "Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts," Shames said. Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. "To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster," said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. "There were other means to manage the emergency." The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. "First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms," said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.Willingness to dealAt least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are "just and reasonable." FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. "In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so," said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. "We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone." Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. "The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market," said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. Sempra says contract fairThe company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. "It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' " Niggli said. But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. "There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to," White said. "The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. "But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?" *****************************************************************State authority buying more power for 2002 Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss OC Register, 10.07.01SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. "We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. "The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. Said Freeman: "We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks." New contracts would increase 'green' power In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called "peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. "I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them Even the state's businesses are critical. They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. "I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis. The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. "It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But "it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. "The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. "Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''

"In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so," said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. "We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone." Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. "The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market," said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. Sempra says contract fairThe company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. "It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' " Niggli said. But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. "There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to," White said. "The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. "But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?" *****************************************************************State authority buying more power for 2002 Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss OC Register, 10.07.01SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. "We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. "The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. Said Freeman: "We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks." New contracts would increase 'green' power In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called "peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. "I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them Even the state's businesses are critical. They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. "I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis. The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. "It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But "it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. "The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. "Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''

Looks like Brown might not be getting the presidency right away....Best,Jeff****************************************************PUC Chief's Iron Resolve Evident in Edison DealPolitics: Insisting on her agency's independence, Loretta Lynch repeatedly stood up to the governor who appointed her.SACRAMENTO -- Once again last week, California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch gave Gov. Gray Davis help that he badly needed--but left him upstaged.With the governor unable to broker a deal to save Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, Lynch and commission lawyers secretly negotiated a $3.3-billion settlement that was ratified by a federal judge in Los Angeles on Friday.Although Davis appointed Lynch as PUC president, she and administration officials say she informed the administration of the talks only after they were well underway. "I will take responsibility," Lynch said.Even as she took the lead in forging an Edison deal, Lynch defied the governor Tuesday. She led the PUC in rejecting a measure that Davis and Treasurer Phil Angelides deem necessary for repaying the state for billions of dollars in power purchases this year. Davis condemned the vote as "an irresponsible act."Davis repeatedly has said he wants people he appoints to think and act as he would act. Lynch, however, is not easily controlled. She has moved ahead without the governor's approval several times. Most notably, last spring, she pushed the largest electricity rate increase in state history through the PUC while Davis was publicly opposed to a rate hike.Such actions have made her perhaps Davis' least favorite appointee.And yet, Lynch holds the key to resolving what now is Davis' single most pressing issue: how to reimburse the state for the billions spent on electricity since January.For months, those power purchases have been eating a huge hole in the state treasury. Unless a way is found to close it, Davis may have to make deep cuts in public services next year just as he prepares to run for reelection. He has proposed reimbursing the treasury with a $12.5-billion bond issue that would be paid off by electricity consumers.Davis would not discuss Lynch for this article. But his aides say there is so much tension between the two that the governor and Lynch talk only through intermediaries. A top aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, described the governor's relationship with Lynch, who once served on Davis' staff, as "nonexistent."But floating the bond deal requires action by the PUC, and Davis aides admit that figuring out a way to do that means dealing with Lynch, whose term does not expire until 2005 and whose influence is now stronger than ever, according to fellow commissioners and others familiar with the agency.Davis could demote Lynch from PUC president to just commissioner, but "he can't remove commissioners," said the Davis aide who described the tension between the two. "We are in a position where we're going to have to negotiate."A Yale-educated attorney who practiced in San Francisco before joining the administration, Lynch worked on Davis' 1998 campaign, helping him raise money. He rewarded her loyalty by making her head of the Office of Research and Planning, then placing her on the PUC in late 1999.Lynch has taken seriously the idea, enshrined in the early 20th century laws that created the PUC, that the commission is supposed to be independent.She recalls spending Christmas 1999 reading the Public Utilities Code, written 90 years ago, and concluding that Progressive Gov. Hiram Johnson envisioned "an independent agency, independent from the Legislature as well as from the governor, [that] would allow regulators in a highly technical field to do essentially the right thing.""Before, I was on [Davis'] staff, and as staff, you are supposed to follow the lead absolutely of your boss," Lynch said. "Now, I was appointed to an independent constitutional body. While I feel I've built bridges to the governor and the Legislature, I take very seriously the PUC's constitutional independence."Critics, including many in the Davis administration and some in the Legislature, call Lynch unbending. She is particularly adamant on the commission's independence.Insisting on IndependenceAccounts of how the Edison deal was reached underline Lynch's insistence on preserving the PUC's independent authority. The events also show how strong a position she holds as the PUC and the administration negotiate over the bond deal.Starting in April, when he unveiled his proposed rescue of Edison, Davis and his aides lobbied hard to win support in the Legislature. Davis had no Republican support, and faced skepticism from fellow Democrats.Lynch was another skeptic; Davis' proposal would have weakened the PUC's authority to regulate Edison. Her criticism of the proposal strengthened the hand of Senate Leader John Burton (D-San Francisco), an ally of Lynch's and the most influential critic of the governor's proposal.Davis did win approval of a modified version of his plan in the Assembly. But late on Sept. 14, the Senate adjourned for the year without agreeing to any Edison bill.The governor said he would order lawmakers to return to Sacramento in early October for a special session to consider it again.Lynch seized an opportunity. She wanted to escape a $5.5-billion federal lawsuit that Edison had filed against the PUC. She also figured there might be a way to restructure Edison's debt without the bells and whistles proposed by Davis and other lawmakers.It was a good time to talk. Wholesale electricity prices were down significantly, interest rates were falling, and the rate increase she had pushed through earlier in the year had made more money available to the utility."When we looked at the numbers fresh, we realized that the numbers had changed," enough that Edison might avoid bankruptcy without a complex legislative bailout, Lynch said.At her direction, PUC General Counsel Gary Cohen made the initial call to Edison.Edison, PUC Started Secret TalksEdison executives had their doubts that the PUC could resolve the utility's problems. In their view, past inaction by the commission had helped bring the firm to the brink of bankruptcy.But with prospects uncertain in the Legislature, both sides met Sept. 19 in the San Francisco offices of the utility's private counsel, Munger, Tolles & Olson. Talks went on for 12 days.The PUC had three conditions. "One, we would try to see if we could assure them enough in rates to pay back down their debt over a certain period," Cohen said. "Second, there would have to be a sharing of pain by shareholders. And third, there could be no terms that would limit or restrict the commission's regulatory authority."Lynch and the PUC staff kept negotiations secret. Word of the talks could stampede creditors into forcing the utility into bankruptcy, they feared. Another concern was that the talks could jeopardize a legislative solution to Edison's problem.Lynch did notify her fellow commissioners, whose support she would need to pull off a settlement. PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown, one of three Davis appointees on the five-member board, said Lynch told him Sept. 21 "in the strictest confidence" about the negotiations with Edison."If it became public, it could blow up," Brown said. "There would be too much hullabaloo."For several days, however, Lynch did not inform Davis. Meanwhile, the governor's aides continued to hold talks in hopes of putting together a legislative compromise.On Sept. 25, some of Davis' top aides met with key legislative staffers in a daylong session. By the end of the meeting, both sides realized a major gulf remained.That same day, Lynch called Sacramento to pass word to Davis that the talks were underway. A few lawmakers also were told. Two days later, the governor announced that he was postponing by a week his call for the Legislature to return for a special session. One reason for the delay was to see whether the PUC could seal a deal.Over the next several days, the commission and utility lawyers hammered out the details of the $3.3-billion rescue plan, finalizing a deal about 11 p.m. Sept. 30."It would not have gotten over the finish line without her," said attorney Ron Olson, an Edison board member who helped represent the utility in the talks.While those negotiations were going on, Davis was going to extraordinary lengths to persuade the PUC to approve the other major item on the commission's plate: his proposal for the bond deal.The issue is complex. But at its root, Lynch said, the proposal pushed by Davis and Angelides to pay off the bonds would have the effect of locking in multiyear power contracts that the Davis administration struck with independent power producers.Lynch and several lawmakers contend that the administration is committing the state to buy too much electricity at excessive prices and seeking to limit the PUC's authority.The PUC under Lynch has challenged aspects of the administration's power contracts in proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.Knowing that Lynch opposed the proposal, the governor tried to create a majority that would bypass her. He did not call Lynch, but did call Republican commissioners Richard Bilas and Henry Duque.The governor's lobbying changed no votes; his proposal lost 4 to 1 with only Brown siding with him.But his efforts appear to have enhanced Lynch's standing among her fellow commissioners, including the two Republicans, who are appointees of former Gov. Pete Wilson.Commissioners Praise LynchIn Bilas' view, the call from the governor showed that Lynch had the mettle to vote against the administration proposal, even if it might cost her her job as PUC president."There are only two kinds of people who can serve: a yes man, or a person who believes that the commission was set up to be independent, and she is of the second type," Bilas said.Brown, the only commissioner to vote for the administration's bond proposal, credits Lynch as well."She stood up for the authority of the PUC," Brown said. Brown--a cousin of Davis' onetime boss, former Gov. Jerry Brown--is a potential successor to Lynch as president if Davis decides to demote her. He has not been offered the post and does not want it, Brown said."I hope they don't remove her as president," Brown said. "She is a feisty, independent individual, but she is capable of enormous good work. If you appoint her, you have to take her on days you agree with her and days you disagree with her. She is not going to be a sycophant, and that is to her credit."

michael.tribolet@enron.com,michael.tribolet@enron.com,michael.tribolet@enron.com,Subject: ,Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. Or maybe not. While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. Duress allegedConsumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. "We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically," said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal." Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. "The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts," Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. "Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts," Shames said. Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. "To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster," said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. "There were other means to manage the emergency." The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. "First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms," said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.Willingness to dealAt least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are "just and reasonable." FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. "In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so," said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. "We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate.

Gray Davis named political operative Loretta Lynch to the state Public Utilities Commission -- and insisted that she become the PUC's president as well -- it was in keeping with Davis' long-established mode of personally controlling major political levers. All of that occurred, however, before California was plunged into the "energy crisis," an infuriatingly complex amalgam of politics, economics, power supply and distribution, and such uncontrollable factors as the weather. When the first strains were felt 1 1/2 years ago, Davis and Lynch reacted, as one might expect, in tandem and, as later experience proved, poorly. They refused, in effect, to intercede with some steps -- such as long-term, low-price supply contracts and perhaps small rate increases -- that would have prevented the situation from deteriorating into a crisis. Last January, when the financial plight of the privately owned utilities brought the threat of major power blackouts, Davis and Lynch were forced to act. But within a couple of months, the previously inseparable partners began cleaving apart, at least publicly. At Lynch's behest, the PUC enacted a stiff rate increase while Davis claimed that she and the PUC had acted on their own, without his knowledge. It was widely seen at the time as a ploy, one that would bring about a rate boost that every authority knew was necessary, without forcing Davis to publicly change position. Since then, the two have continued to act in seemingly divergent ways. The PUC stepped into the political stalemate over Southern California Edison, for example, working up a secret deal that apparently will protect the utility from bankruptcy without having to win legislative approval. And the PUC has opposed the authority sought by the Davis administration to finance bonds that would pay for past and future state power purchases. Administration officials are publicly critical of Lynch and the PUC and circulate stories that Davis considers her to be an impediment. One version had Davis dumping her as president of the PUC in favor of a friendlier member. And PUC officials insist that Lynch is just acting to preserve the historic independence of the agency, first created nearly a century ago as a bulwark against the out-of-control Southern Pacific railroad. A lengthy article in Monday's Los Angeles Times traced the history of the Davis-Lynch relationship and, in effect, endorsed the conventional wisdom that the two erstwhile political allies had grown apart under the strain of the energy crisis. That may be true, but the intensity with which that interpretation of events is being peddled makes one suspicious that it's just another ploy aimed at protecting the governor's backside from the fallout of his less-than-deft handling of the energy situation. Polls indicate that it's the primary reason why his public approval rating has dropped dramatically this year, thus making his re-election next year less than certain. By doing the deal on Edison -- supposedly without Davis' knowledge -- Lynch saved the governor from a huge embarrassment. He had gone to the mat for the utility but was rebuffed by a Legislature dominated by his own party. He had called a special legislative session on Edison but had been told that he would lose again. Holding up approval of the administration's bond-power contract scheme is often cited as the most powerful evidence of a schism between Davis and Lynch, but she may be doing the governor a big favor in that arena as well. The contracts signed by the administration are much too expensive and, if implemented, will cost ratepayers billions of extra dollars over the next decade. Davis needs to dump them, but if he acts directly, he'll have to admit that he made a mistake. If the PUC continues to hold up the necessary authority, he can use that as a lever to force suppliers into whittling down prices, or even abandoning the contracts altogether -- without having to take responsibility for reneging. Maybe Davis and Lynch are feuding, but it could all just be a charade to fool the public and protect the governor.

Gray Davis' administration. The power traders accuse the Independent System Operator -- which is legally required to act as an impartial market manager -- of improperly helping state power buyers spread out the cost of high-priced electricity contracts. Energy firms as well as municipal utility systems have complained about mysterious charges on their accounts with the grid agency, said Jan Smutney- Jones of the Independent Energy Producers Association, which represents such industry giants as Enron, Dynegy, Williams and Reliant. The charges showed up around the time the state Department of Water Resources was forced to start selling excess electricity it had purchased at an average of $69 per megawatt hour for as little as $1 per megawatt hour. "The ISO seems to be following specific instructions the Department of Water Resources is giving them," Smutney-Jones said. An industry source said NRG Energy Inc. and other suppliers were preparing a formal complaint to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which could order the state to issue refunds to generators if it finds they have been improperly charged. The commission has ordered an unprecedented operational audit of the grid management agency. State officials bought power under long-term contracts when it appeared California could suffer serious power shortages over the summer. Instead, the state had more than enough power, and electricity available on the spot market suddenly cost half as much as the energy California had bought. Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry group, said the grid operator was using a combination of power scheduling and billing practices to "bury" some of the cost of power purchased by the state in the accounts of other generators. "The state is the biggest buyer and seller of electricity, and they control the governing board of the ISO," Ackerman said. The governor's spokesman, Steve Maviglio, called the power firms' accusations "absolutely false" and said the generators were trying to whip up sentiment in Washington to interfere with the state's affairs. "The generators know they'll get a much better deal at FERC headquarters in Washington than they will in Sacramento," Maviglio said. "It shouldn't be a surprise that they make these accusations here to get federal involvement." Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the Department of Water Resources, said generators could hardly cast themselves as victims in California's energy crisis. "I don't feel sorry for them one bit," Hidalgo said. "They had one heck of a year." Gregg Fishman, spokesman for the ISO said the agency was preparing a response to the accusations. Energy trade organizations said they suspected the ISO of using several mechanisms to charge suppliers for state contract costs. The extra expense is sometimes tacked on to suppliers' bills for ISO operating costs, which all electricity sellers in California share, Ackerman said. Some firms say they have tried to buy cheap spot market electricity for resale, only to find later that the grid manager has charged them for more expensive state power. Others say the grid operator orders them to activate stand-by power units on too-short notice. When they can't comply, they say, the ISO brings high-priced state power on line and bills them for the extra cost. The accusations are part of a struggle for control of California's grid. In January, Davis disbanded the ISO's 26-member governing board, which was chaired by Smutney-Jones, after some critics said it was too cozy with industry. Davis appointed his own five-member board. In February, then-FERC Chairman Curt Hebert said the new board had become "a political arm of the governor." The commission is trying to get California to turn over its grid to a multistate transmission organization. Davis has warned Washington to "keep its hands off" the ISO.

Tough break.  Is the judge's proposed decision available?Best,JeffFERC Judge Urges Dismissal Of Calif Complaint Vs El PasoWASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- An administrative law judge has recommended the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission dismiss a complaint alleging El Paso Corp. (EPG) manipulated the market for natural gas sales into California . The ruling in the high-profile, politically charged case was a setback for California , which had sought to hold El Paso financially accountable not only for higher natural gas prices, but also for the resulting higher electricity prices in a state heavily dependent upon gas-fired power plants. "While ... El Paso Pipeline and El Paso Merchant had the ability to exercise market power, the record in this case isn't at all clear that they in fact exercised market power," Curtis Wagner, FERC's chief administrative law judge, concluded in an initial decision forwarded to the commission late Tuesday. The California Public Utilities Commission, which filed the complaint against El Paso, said later Tuesday that it would appeal Wagner's decision on market manipulation. In a small victory for the state, Wagner did find that El Paso officials violated FERC's "standards of conduct" rules barring the sharing of market-sensitive information between pipeline companies and their natural-gas marketing affiliates. "El Paso Corp., El Paso Pipeline, and El Paso Merchant are guilty of affiliate abuse," Wagner concluded. "There was a dialogue between the pipeline affiliates and the marketing affiliate that gave an unfair advantage to the bidding" by the marketing unit for El Paso pipeline capacity into California , Wagner said. FERC had dismissed the issue of affiliate abuse on March 28 without a hearing. At Wagner's request, the commission later agreed to reopen the issue during a hearing into the market-manipulation complaint. The proceeding, which began April 4 and concluded August 6, resulted in a hearing record of 32 volumes and totaled 5,573 pages, while 515 exhibits were entered into evidence, Wagner reported. "The briefs measured approximately one linear foot," he said.       Contracting With Affiliates    At issue are contracts worth $38.5 million that El Paso's marketing unit entered into with its pipeline affiliate to secure 1.2 billion cubic feet per day of firm transportation capacity into California from March 2000 through June 2001. California argued El Paso had used its control of pipeline space to limit the supply of gas into the state and boost prices. The contract period coincided with an unprecedented period of power-market volatility, in which skyrocketing natural gas costs contributed to extreme spikes in electricity prices that ultimately rendered the state's utilities insolvent. The judge found that the contracts gave El Paso Merchant more than a 35% market share, the market-power threshold under FERC's merger guidelines, based on his interpretation of the relevant market. El Paso had argued for the higher antitrust-law threshold of 50%, but Wagner ruled that the lower standard should apply. But while that market share gave El Paso the "ability to exercise market power," Wagner said, "it is not at all clear from the record in the proceeding that El Paso Merchant and El Paso Pipeline exercised market power." The record offers only mixed support for allegations by the CPUC and utilities in the state that El Paso withheld gas supplies to drive up prices, Wagner said. From March through October 2000, El Paso's capacity utilization rate was about half the rate of other shippers, while for the remainder of the contract, the full capacity was used. Wagner concluded that El Paso's compliance with FERC rules requiring companies that control pipeline capacity to offer unused capacity to other shippers constituted an effective check against market power.       Improper Communications Seen    Where the state scored a win was in the second phase of the hearing, where Wagner heard evidence on allegations of affiliate abuse. Wagner cited telephone records and correspondence to conclude that El Paso violated FERC rules requiring pipelines and affiliated marketers to operate independently of one another. The rules also restrict communications between pipeline operating personnel and affiliated marketers. Transcripts of telephone conversations between pipeline and marketing employees of El Paso "demonstrate blatant collusion ... to keep secret a discount for service" on El Paso's Mojave system until the open season was over in which Merchant was bidding for the pipeline capacity on the sister pipeline, Wagner said, including the transcripts in his opinion. Wagner determined that the transcript offered a "prima facie" case of affiliate abuse, and urged El Paso to present witnesses to rebut his finding. But El Paso declined to present the witnesses, the opinion noted. Wagner also cited a confidential memorandum to William Wise, El Paso's chief executive, from the head of El Paso Merchant as contributing to his conclusion that El Paso and its pipeline and marketing affiliates "were in clear violation" of FERC's affiliate-abuse rules. El Paso replied in a statement that the commission had considered the same evidence and found no abuse in its March 28 ruling. The commission would commit a "legal error" if it adopted the judge's views, the company said. The parties have 30 days to file briefs taking exception to the judge's findings. The commission can either accept or reject the judge's findings. However the commission ultimately rules in the case, it is expected to end up appealed before a federal appeals court.

The bond sale stalled last week when the California Public Utilities Commission voted 4-1 against a plan to repay the state's power costs using utility rates. The commissioners favor another approach, opposed by Davis, that would give them more authority over the state's $43 billion of power contracts. Some commissioners ``would probably be amenable to the rate agreement if there was movement on the governor's part to renegotiate those contracts,'' said Geoffrey Brown, who was appointed to the PUC by Davis. ``We're not just sitting around waiting for the sky to fall. There's got to be some give here.'' Moody's Investors Service on Friday said California's $31.6 billion of debt may be downgraded for the second time this year, in part because of the delayed bond sale. California's budget deficit in fiscal 2003 may reach $9.3 billion if energy costs aren't repaid, state Treasurer Philip Angelides said. The state has spent $10.4 billion since January buying electricity on behalf of PG&E Corp. and Edison International utilities, which are insolvent. Davis `Willing to Discuss' ``It takes two to tango and we are certainly willing to discuss the contracts,'' said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. Davis will consider Brown's offer, ``especially in context'' of any refunds from generators that may be ordered, Maviglio said. State officials claim power generators have charged too much, and are asking federal regulators to order refunds. Power generators are ``willing to discuss it, but I wouldn't want anybody to have any false promise or hope that any enormous change will come from this,'' said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing power sellers. Any companies willing to talk ``might want something else in return, and who knows what that might be.'' The planned bond sale, the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history, would repay the state's general fund for a $6.1 billion power loan and cover other power costs. The sale has been delayed by the disagreements among state leaders. `A Blank Check' Under state law, the PUC is required to provide enough revenue from consumer rates to meet the bond payments and cover power contracts. The Department of Water Resources, the state agency buying the power, has sole authority to determine its revenue needs. PUC President Loretta Lynch and others said an irrevocable financing order would make it difficult for the state to renegotiate power contracts. They also said the DWR has been given too much authority. In the past, the PUC has set utility rates. ``It gives a blank check to the DWR for anything that they want to do going forward,'' said California Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton. The commissioners favor a plan to back the bonds with a surcharge on utility customers' bills. The proposal would let the PUC review the water department's revenue requirements and require a public hearing on the allocation of costs among the utilities. Davis opposes that plan. ``It's dead on arrival. It's still going to be vetoed,'' said Maviglio. The governor has until Sunday to sign or veto all the bills sent to him during the last session. The new plan would expose the state to breach-of-contract claims, the governor's office said in a statement last week. The state agreed with power generators to pay energy contracts before repaying the bonds. Making a change now ``would eliminate the security on which the power sellers relied'' the governor's office said in the statement. Critics of the long-term power contracts say the state's economy will be hurt by above-market costs for years to come. No matter which approach the state takes, ``the government ought to try to renegotiate the contracts anyway,'' Burton said. ``And some of the generators have said they're willing to do it.''

Critics said that with California beginning to emerge from a two-year energy crisis triggered by a failed deregulation law that drowned the state's utilities in red ink, now is no time to abandon state oversight. Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), called the plan "a regulatory jailbreak" and "a corporate shell game to evade proper state regulation" by transferring assets to unregulated PG&E affiliates. The reorganization plan would split the parent company and its utility into stand-alone companies, transferring the hydro network, Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant and gas and electric transmission systems to unregulated units of parent PG&E. The utility would continue to own and operate local gas and power distribution grids serving about 13 million customers. The plan would allow all valid creditor claims to be paid without the need for a rate increase or state bailout, said Bob Glynn, chairman, president and chief executive of PG&E. It would provide creditors with about $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in notes. EYE ON HYDRO SYSTEM One of the concerns arising from the plan is how Pacific Gas & Electric would continue to manage its hydroelectric properties, which make up the world's largest privately held hydropower system. Elected officials from 28 counties in PG&E's sprawling hydro watershed in central and northern California will meet Friday to weigh actions on the reorganization plan filed at the San Francisco federal bankruptcy court Sept. 20. The Regional Council of Rural Counties is worried about who will safeguard the environmental health of the hydro system's rivers and lakes that are the foundation for fishing, boating and tourism in an area that sprawls across about two-thirds of the state, council vice president Wes Lujan told Reuters. PG&E spokesman Jon Tremayne said the hydro system, nuclear reactors and transmission systems would continue to be regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The utility also would continue to get power from plants it now owns under a 12-year deal at 5 cents per kilowatt hour. But State Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he is looking closely at the plan because of "serious concerns the utility is seeking to evade further scrutiny by the CPUC" and avoid state laws on the asset transfers. Lockyer said that in the past, PG&E had used CPUC oversight as a shield against federal scrutiny. Despite PG&E's claim that the CPUC has no jurisdiction on the transfer of power and transmission assets to the parent, CPUC chief counsel Gary Cohen said the agency's approval is required under state law. 'FIRE SALE PRICES' "PG&E's goal is clear. They want to transfer most of the utility's valuable assets to an affiliate company, at fire sale prices, so that they will no longer be subject to any state regulation. It is a deregulation plan, not a reorganization plan," Cohen said. "PG&E's plan conflicts with California's interest to have a more stable and regulated energy system. Deregulation has failed the public, and we will look at every opportunity to put down this attempt to solve the failure of deregulation with more deregulation," said Doug Heller, of consumer advocate The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. PG&E's Tremayne said the plan makes the most sense for California because units of PG&E would continue to own and manage power production and transmission. Tremayne said, however, the reorganization plan does not bar a future sale to another company. PG&E's plan would give the utility $4.5 billion from the asset transfers to help pay off about $13 billion in debts, including $9 billion in unrecovered power purchase costs. The CPUC's Cohen and consumer groups said PG&E should receive far more than $4.5 billion from the assets. They point to the value of the hydro network. Last fall, the utility dropped a plan to sell the hydro system to its parent for $2.8 billion because the system was "undervalued in today's market" and could fetch a much higher price through an auction. The PG&E utility and Edison International's Southern California Edison utility amassed billions of dollars of debt because the deregulation law prevented them from passing steep wholesale power prices to their customers. SoCal Edison and the CPUC reached a deal Oct. 2 to keep the utility out of the bankruptcy court and pay off its creditors.

The contracts would force Sierra Pacific Resources' (SRP) utilities Sierra Pacific Power Co. and Nevada Power Co. to pay a higher price for power than current market rates, said Don Soderberg, PUC chairman. "We paid high prices when the prices were high, but to pay high prices when the prices are low is outrageous," Soderberg said. No one at Sierra Pacific or Nevada Power was available to comment on which companies have signed contracts with the utilities, or the value of the contracts. The PUC action follows a letter sent by Gov. Kenny Guinn to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in early October asking that the utilities be allowed to renegotiate the contracts. The General Counsel's office will now have authority to file with FERC and in court to plead against the current contracts. Sierra Pacific has said that a June FERC order that capped wholesale power prices has penalized the company. Sierra Pacific signed its forward contracts to escape high spot market prices, only to have those contracts end up being more expensive than the capped spot market prices, the company has said. As well, if the company wants to sell any surplus power into the spot market, it will now receive less for that power under the cap, it has said. California 's Public Utilities Commission is also pushing for renegotiation of $43 billion in long-term contracts signed by the state, which has been buying power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities since January.

SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis is crafting a new plan to expedite the long-delayed borrowing of $12.5 billion to repay the sagging California state budget for emergency electricity it bought during the energy crisis. The plan -- which could be contained in an executive order as early as next week -- would minimize the role of the state's top power regulator, the Public Utilities Commission, which enraged Davis last week when it declined to sign off on his original plan. With enough power now under contract to avert blackouts and plans in place for the recovery of the two state's largest utilities, the repayment to the state treasury would resolve one of the last remaining issues of the energy crisis. "That is one scenario," Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said Wednesday when asked about the proposal. "There are a number of different scenarios being considered. Nothing has jelled yet that is ready to be publicly announced." Most involved in the debate have long agreed that the state should sell $12.5 billion in revenue bonds, most of which, about $9.6 billion, would go back into the state treasury. The issue was how to lock in a mechanism by which the bonds would be repaid - a critical step before they could be marketed to investors. Davis wanted the PUC to approve a plan that would repay the bonds and cover the state's energy costs through the revenues collected from ratepayers. But the PUC said the administration's proposal might prove inadequate over time, leading to future rate hikes. The PUC also said the administration's plan gave too much authority to the Davis-controlled Department of Water Resources, by allowing the department to raise electricity rates to get more revenue. The PUC, which is set up to be an independent board with the sole responsibility for setting utility rates, did not want to cede that authority. It rejected the Davis plan Oct. 2 on a 4-1 vote, led by its president, Davis appointee Loretta Lynch. Davis earlier said the commission's approval was necessary to reassure investors and get the bonds to market. The plan now under review, however, would bypass that. The DWR would not directly set rates, but under the Davis plan it would be charged with identifying how the money coming in from customers' utility bills over the next 20 years would be allocated - in effect, guaranteeing that paying back the bonds would have equal priority with paying back the suppliers of the energy. Proponents of the plan believe that would satisfy Wall Street. The administration believes it would require no additional rate hikes. Lynch said Wednesday that she had not been involved in the latest negotiations, but questioned whether Davis had the authority to issue an executive order allowing the DWR to get involved in setting rates. "I've been told for six months that the PUC was needed to pass a rate agreement. If the DWR can get the bonds sold by themselves, then great," Lynch said. "But to dedicate rates, it takes a financing order from the PUC or a statutory change in law, a statutory set-aside. It takes one of those two things." The governor is likely to announce the plan sometime following his expected veto of the bill that lays out the Legislature's version of the payback plan. By law, the governor has until Sunday to act on SB18xx, by Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco. Davis opposes Burton's bill because it gives bond buyers priority in getting paid, followed by the energy suppliers. The power companies' contracts contain provisions giving them payment priority, which Davis believes could throw the contracts into legal dispute. If Davis signs the order soon, the bonds could go to market early next year. Having the proceeds in the state treasury by then is considered by some critical with the state facing a projected $4 billion to $6 billion shortfall in other income.

We're trying to find out more.Alternative SDG&E debt plan to get hearings Approval of the governor's plan for paying the $747 million debt SDG&E says it is owed by its customers appeared less certain yesterday, as the president of the state utilities commission said she planned to hold public hearings for an alternative proposal. Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said in a local radio interview that regulators will hold hearings in San Diego regarding a plan from consumer groups that purports to save customers about $185 million more than the governor's proposal. The groups said the earlier plan negotiated between the governor and the utility would be costly for consumers and a windfall for San Diego Gas & Electric. At stake is how much SDG&E contributes and how much customers pay toward the debt, which accumulated in a so-called balancing account when SDG&E paid more for electricity than it was able to collect from customers during the power crisis. Despite the plan for hearings, Lynch told KPBS-FM radio that the commission would make a final decision about how to resolve the controversial $747 million debt by November. The governor and SDG&E announced their plan in June, saying it required the utility to contribute $319 million toward the debt and eliminated the balancing account without lengthy litigation or raising rates. Consumer groups, led by the San Diego-based Utility Consumers' Action Network, say the governor's plan does not go far enough, particularly because SDG&E earned an estimated $400 million in profits from the sale of electricity during the power crisis. Under the governor's plan, those profits are awarded to the company's shareholders, though SDG&E would use $219 million from the profits as part of its $319 million contribution toward the debt. Under the consumer groups' plan, SDG&E would be allowed to keep some of the profits, but it would contribute $72 million more than it would under the governor's plan. The alternative plan also would require the utility to make other monetary concessions. In a formal decision earlier this year, the California utilities commission said SDG&E's profits do belong to customers. SDG&E has sued to overturn the decision in court, but it has put the litigation on hold pending the utilities commission's resolution of the plan to pay the debt. Michael Shames, executive director of UCAN, said yesterday that he was encouraged by Lynch's call for hearings on the consumer plan. "There is $400 million at stake here," Shames said. SDG&E said yesterday that it had not received formal notification about the hearings, nor had it yet seen the alternative plan for paying the debt. A spokesman for the utility, however, repeated earlier comments that the company saw the alternative plan as an attempt to derail the PUC's process of considering the governor's plan. Lynch also said yesterday that the utilities commission would continue to challenge the more than $40 billion in long-term electricity contracts signed by the state during the crisis. Lynch said the agreements bind the state to overpriced power and are in violation of federal law requiring electricity rates to be "just and reasonable." The utilities commission president said the contracts may be even more expensive than earlier thought because at least some of the power they bind California to purchase is not needed. The extra costs would damage businesses and family budgets, she said. "If you have to pay three to four times more for energy, you don't have the money to grow your business or meet other needs of your family," Lynch said. She also defended action by the commission last week that effectively delayed the sale of $12.5 billion in state bonds needed to pay power costs. Lynch said the commission supported a legislative proposal for floating the bonds, which would separate them from the long-term power contracts.

What right does the PG&E creditor committee have to either 1) ask PG&E whether it's begun talks--informal or otherwise--with the PUC, and/or 2) request that PG&E begin talks?  I'm assuming that there may be some chance for #1, but very little, if any, for #2.  Thanks.Best,JeffEdison pact could point way for PG&E The multibillion-dollar settlement between Southern California Edison and California regulators could ultimately ripple well beyond homes and businesses in the south state. It might form rough outlines for a deal that could pull Pacific Gas and Electric Co. out of bankruptcy without removing its assets from state regulation. The pact between Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission also might presage a nimbler PUC, one likelier to strike closed-door deals without its typical months of testimony, briefs and hearings. Along with its statewide impacts, which may not fully unfold for years, the settlement with the state's second-largest utility also raises uncertainties for its customers, who will pay billions to retire its debts. One week after a federal judge approved the $6.35 billion pact to restore Edison to financial health after wholesale power costs spiraled out of control, it is becoming increasingly clear that much of the cost will be born by south state consumers. From the start, the Edison rescue plan was a stealth settlement. It was negotiated in secret, approved in a closed meeting and so murky that days afterward, even some PUC analysts were still debating just how much money was involved. "It's definitely ambiguously worded," said Steve Linsey, a supervisor in the PUC's semi-independent Office of Ratepayer Advocates. On his first review of the deal, he thought about $1.7 billion would be paid by customers through future electric rates. But that figure will be at least $3.3 billion and probably higher, according to Edison and those who negotiated the deal for the PUC. "There seems to be a lot of off-the-books interpretation in a direction that is unfavorable to ratepayers," Linsey said. The PUC settlement emerged after the Senate and Assembly deadlocked over how much money should flow to Edison and what other benefits should be included for the company and some of its customers. In addition, the PUC gave Edison permission to use small and large customers' rates to collect much of the money to pay off back debts, bypassing legislative bargaining to shield residential consumers. And the PUC settlement took a much broader view of Edison's finances, sweeping in old debts and cash on hand, and then basically authorized a blueprint to pay off $6.35 billion in debts. About three-fourths of that amount -- $4.9 billion -- appears to come from the utility's customers. Edison's investors will pick up $1.5 billion -- $1.2 billion through eliminating shareholder dividends for three years, and $300 million as a company contribution. The clearest-cut customer contribution flows into a $3.3 billion pot to be filled by future electric bills, probably through the end of 2003. But that's not their only contribution. Another $1.6 billion would come from Edison's cash on hand, which includes money already collected from rates and loans that will eventually be repaid by customers. "In the end, you're right, the vast sum of money here comes from ratepayers," said Brian Bennett, Edison vice president of external affairs. But if Edison had won its suit, Bennett said, it would have been entitled to the full $6.35 billion, without its shareholders taking any hit at all. No one can know who would have won the Edison suit. Both sides say they had compelling legal arguments. So why did the PUC, after maintaining publicly for months that it would prevail, chose to settle? Partly, the commission was getting gloomy forecasts from the law firm it had hired, said PUC commissioner Richard Bilas. But he and others said there was another, looming fear. The PG&E bankruptcy reorganization plan, filed Sept. 20, called for shifting utility assets, including the company's hydroelectric plants, nuclear plant, and gas storage and pipeline network, to a firm free from state regulation. "People's calculus was shaken up by what PG&E did," said Mike Florio, an attorney for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer group. "It was just in the ether that 'oh God, there's something really ugly out there. We don't think they can get away with it, but we're not entirely sure.'" The reorganization plan would leave a new PG&E company free to set its own rates for power that its plants produce. That prospect horrifies regulators and lawmakers who have watched unregulated generators set market prices so high they crippled PG&E and Edison. They plan to fight PG&E's efforts, and one of their key tools could be showing the judge that the PUC has been able to salvage Edison while keeping it regulated. "They could say, 'judge, you don't have to do this bad deal that PG&E wants. We can work it out,'" said Randy Chinn, an adviser to state Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey. For its part, PG&E maintains that the PUC should have helped it out last fall with something similar to the Edison deal. But now, the utility said, it prefers its bankruptcy reorganization plan. PUC chief counsel Gary Cohen predicts that if the utility's efforts are rejected by the bankruptcy judge, PG&E will have to begin consultations with regulators for some sort of solution. "I think it would be smarter to be talking now," he said. A PG&E rescue wouldn't follow the Edison settlement exactly because PG&E's debts and costs are higher, Cohen said, but the PUC's goal would be the same goal it held for Edison: a healthy, regulated utility. Consumer groups have blasted the settlement for funneling money to Edison after the utility was allowed to essentially pad its bills during the late 1990s to position itself for deregulation. A PUC majority took a similar stance for more than a year -- until the Edison settlement. "We finally got to the point where we said look, we've seen the alternatives, and the alternatives are something like what PG&E is trying to do, or having the state take over the business of buying power," Cohen said. Most people at the commission, he said, concluded that a regulated utility looks much more appealing than unregulated power plants or the state Department of Water Resources, which has been buying power for cash-strapped utilities since January. Cohen, who orchestrated the Edison settlement negotiations, said they had to be kept quiet for fear that a leak could trigger a bankruptcy filing. Bilas said if it had leaked, so many people would have tried to stop the deal that it likely would have been torpedoed. At a closed session before approving it, he said, every commissioner worried aloud that they were sidestepping their own frequent calls for due process, full information and proper hearings. It is far too early to say whether more closed door deals will follow. Bilas, Florio and others predict the current PUC has little taste for them. But the five-member commission continues to evolve each time a term expires and the governor appoints a new commissioner. "It scares the hell out of me what a really pro-utility commission would do with this," said Florio, the consumer advocate. "This could be the beginning of something really ugly." In addition, if utilities see federal suits as way to slice through time-consuming PUC procedures, a flurry of suits could follow, said Linsey of the Ratepayer Advocates' Office.

Eldon and Nancy:  Here's the WSJ editorial by Scott Simon--long-time NPR dude, credentialed lib, and Quaker--on "just wars."  Sort of thought-provoking.Best,JeffOctober 11, 2001CommentaryEven Pacifists MustSupport This WarBy Scott Simon, the host of National Public Radio's "Weekend Edition With Scott Simon."Pacifists often commit the same mistake as generals: They prepare for the last war, not the next one. Many of the peace activists I have seen trying to rouse opposition to today's war against terrorism remind me of a Halloween parade. They put on old, familiar-looking protest masks -- against American imperialism, oppression and violence -- that bear no resemblance to the real demons haunting us now.Pacifism has never been exactly popular. But when I became a Quaker as an adolescent in the late 1960s, pacifism seemed to offer a compelling alternative to the perpetuity of brute force. Mahatma Gandhi had overthrown an empire and Martin Luther King had overturned a racial tyranny with nonviolent marches, fasts, and boycotts that were nervy, ennobling and effective. Pacifism seemed to offer a chance for survival to a generation that had been stunted by the fear of nuclear extinction.I worked as a war reporter, but I never saw a conflict between this and being a Quaker. If my reporting was sometimes drawn more to human details than to the box-score kind of war coverage, those details struck me as critical to explaining war. I never covered a conflict -- whether in Central America, the Caribbean, Africa or the Middle East -- that seriously shook my religious convictions. In fact, most conflicts seemed to prove how war was rotten, wasteful and useless. El Salvador's civil war killed 70,000 people over nine years. It was hard to see how the political compromise that ended the conflict could not have been reached after just six months.But in the 1990s, I covered the Balkans. In Sarajevo, Srebrenica, and Kosovo, I confronted the logical flaw (or perhaps I should say the fatal flaw) of nonviolent resistance: All the best people can be killed by all the worst ones. I had never believed that pacifism had all the answers; neither does militarism. About half of all draft age Quakers enlisted in World War II, believing that whatever wisdom pacifism had to give the world, it could not defeat the murderous schemes of Adolf Hitler and his cohorts.It seems to me that in confronting the forces that attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, American pacifists have no sane alternative now but to support war. I don't consider this reprisal or revenge, but self-defense: protecting the world from further attacks by destroying those who would launch them.Some peace activists, their judgment still hobbled by shock, seem to believe that the attacks against New York and Washington were natural disasters: terrible, unpredictable whirlwinds that struck once and will not reoccur.This is wrong. We know now that there has been an ongoing violent campaign aimed at bringing down diverse nations, with none being more gloriously speckled than the U.S. People who try to hold certain American policies or culture responsible are trying to decorate the crimes of psychotics with synthetic political significance.In 1933 the Oxford Student Union conducted a famous debate over whether it was moral for Britons to fight for king and country. The exquisite intellects of that leading university reviewed the many ways in which British colonialism exploited and oppressed the world. They cited the ways in which vengeful demands made of Germany in the wake of World War I had helped to kindle nationalism and fascism. They saw no moral difference between Western colonialism and world fascism. The Oxford Union ended that debate with this famous proclamation: "Resolved, that we will in no circumstances fight for king and country."Von Ribbentrop sent back the good news to Germany's new chancellor, Hitler: The West will not fight for its own survival. Its finest minds will justify a silent surrender.In short, the best-educated young people of their time could not tell the difference between the deficiencies of their own nation, in which liberty and democracy were cornerstones, and a dictatorship founded on racism, tyranny and fear.And what price would those who urge reconciliation today pay for peace? Should Americans impose a unitary religious state, throw women out of school and work, and rob other religious groups of their rights, so that we have the kind of society the attackers accept? Do pacifists really want to live in the kind of world that the terrorists who hit the World Trade Center and Pentagon would make?Pacifists do not need any lectures about risking their lives to stop wickedness. Quakers resisted slavery by smuggling out slaves when even Abraham Lincoln tried to appease the Confederacy. Pacifists sneaked refugee Jews out of Germany when England and the U.S. were still trying to placate Hitler. Many conscientious objectors have served bravely in gritty and unglamorous tasks that aided the U.S. in time of war.But those of us who have been pacifists must admit that it has been our blessing to live in a nation in which other citizens have been willing to risk their lives to defend our dissent. The war against terrorism does not shove American power into places where it has no place. It calls on America's military strength in a global crisis in which peaceful solutions are not apparent.Only American (and British) power can stop more killing in the world's skyscrapers, pizza parlors, embassies, bus stations, ships, and airplanes. Pacifists, like most Americans, would like to change their country in a thousand ways. And the blasts of Sept. 11 should remind American pacifists that they live in that one place on the planet where change -- in fact, peaceful change -- seems most possible. It is better to sacrifice our ideals than to expect others to die for them.

Thus, for example, with respect to the specific ESP contract described by UC/CSU in their rehearing application, the utilities are required to accept, even after September 20, 2001, any DASRs they receive that legitimatley relate to that contract...[W]e want to make it clear that...utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September 20, 2001."  pp 20-21

f..calger@enron.com,f..calger@enron.com,f..calger@enron.com,Subject: Thoughts on PX Credit Claim with Edison,Chris:A little background (recaps briefly what we discussed on the phone on Monday):A few weeks ago, we (government affairs) approached John Fielder of Edison to see if there was any chance that Edison might be willing to reach a deal on our Negative CTC/PX credit claim.After discussions with RAC, we offered to take 90 cents on the dollar for amounts owed through March 1. (There's general agreement with Edison on what the number is up to January 17, which would only leave 1.17--3.1 in dispute.  But recall there's still the FERC refund issue which complicates the issue.) We asked for 10% down immediately and a binding agreement that Edison would pay us by a date certain sometime in the next quarter.  In exchange, we said we'd drop our law suits at the PUC. In one suit, we're asking the PUC to have Edison pay us. In the other, we've stopped paying Edison for transportation costs until the PUC gets Edison to pay us.  We're depositing what we owe Edison in an escrow account pending resolution.We also agreed to work with Edison to get the PUC to end the whole residual CTC/PX credit framework retroactive to March 1, 2001.  (That would reduce Edison's exposure to negative CTC and our exposure to positive CTC.)For his part, Fielder was looking (in addition) for 1) an agreement on our part to forebear, and 2) an agreement that everyone, including DA customers, should pay what they rightly owe for a) Edison's undercollection, b) the bonds, and c) DWR's stranded contract costs.We never resumed the talks in earnest because soon after our talk, Edison struck its bailout deal with the PUC. With respect to what else we could offer them:From a commercial standpoint, I'm sure you're scouring that front, and I may not have much to add.  But given the credit risk associated with the utility and Edison's other subs, devising a commercial option to help settle the negative CTC claim seems like a challenge.One possible avenue might be the $250 MM in hedging activity the PUC agreed to in its bailout settlement with Edison.  Edison is authorized to hedge its generation and QF fuel costs for up to $250 MM under the settlement. (But this would expose us to PUC regulatory risk, in addition to Edison's credit risk.)Another commercial angle might be Mission Energy, but again, not sure how much better Mission fares from a credit perspective.One idea that we've bounced around that might appeal to Edison--but may or may not be appealing to us--us is to agree to take a note from Edison.  That is, in return for 100 cents on the dollar, we'd agree to take, for example, a 3-year note at some agreed to coupon.  This should appeal to Edison since 1) it takes us off the list of folks who might take them in, 2) it might provide a useful template that Edison could use with other creditors, and 3) it lessens the overall financing Edison needs to arrange (bridge loan, etc.) in the near-term to pay its creditors.The "note" angle could be packaged up with the other regulatory issues explored in the first call with Fielder.Hope this helps.Best,Jeff

The provisions could--and likely will--change.  The leader of the Senate (Burton) is still expressing opposition to DA, so its fate remains unclear.  No suspension of DA.All customers must pay Edison undercollection, whether they've been DA or not.Customers going DA must first clear any payables to DWR for power previously consumed but not full paid for.Customers going DA must pay for DWR's stranded power costs caused by the customer leaving, UNLESS DWR has a net short position, in which case there would be no stranded costs and therefore no fees.The bill allows customers to file a complaint with the PUC regarding DWR's claims of stranded costs.Customers who choose green DA power (defined as 80% renewable) will be exempt from stranded cost fees so long as green DA load does not exceed DWR's net short position.

If you haven't, let me know and I'll have it faxed to you.  In short, Angelides blames all of the financial woes of the State on Loretta and the PUC.  Specifically, he claims that by allowing DA sign-ups to extend to September 20th, the PUC may have shifted over $8 billion to "homeowners, small businesses, and other enterprises..."  Angelides ends the lettery by urging the Commission to immediately roll back the DA suspension date to July 1.The concern, of course, is that Angelides' assertions are out there and have received alot of press attention, i.e., Direct Access=$8 billion tax on homeowners.  To her credit, Loretta refuted Angelides in the press accounts and repeated that the best way to get costs down is to renegotiate the DWR contracts.  She also said in the press accounts that she intends to deal with the July 1/September 20 suspension issue at the next commission meeting.In light of these events (and the increasing attacks on Loretta by Angelides and others in the Administration) It might be useful to give Loretta an assist by drafting a very brief letter to her stating:Angelides is all wet--DA and "fairness" are not mutually exclusive and the PUC has all the regulatory tools necessary to ensure fairness is maintained going forward.  Thus, the 8 plus billion dollar number is without basis.Re-stating that the PUC has no legal authority to retroactively suspend DA to July 1, etc., etc.Folks may have other points to make.  Seems that we'd want to keep the letter short and to the point, however.  A letter might be useful in order to 1) give Loretta some support and 2) get some counter-press in response to the Angelides tantrum.Any thoughts?  Best,Jeff

Other than skepticism from legislative staff about its microturbine bid plan, the Power Authority escaped major problems in its requests for bids for photovoltaics and fuel cells at [18]. [18] Assembly to Investigate Power Authority (from [1]) Is the California Power Authority a dangerously out-of-control state agency, or is it the best hope for get-ting back some state control over electricity supplies? The Joint Legislative Audit Committee is looking into the Power Authority's role thus far in carrying out the letter and spirit of SBx2-6 in a hearing set for November 1. The move is spearheaded by the offices of Assem-blymember Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), the chair of the joint committee, and Assembly speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys). Both members were princi-pal authors of the Power Authority's enabling legisla-tion, SBx2-6. Legislative staff are questioning the Energy Foundation's unpaid role in devel-oping the Power Authority's requests for bids, particularly the RFB for microtur-bines. Only one com-pany, Capstone, can meet the requirement written into the RBF by the Energy Foundation, and staff are looking into potential overlaps between Capstone and the Energy Foundation. Political maneuvers are swirling around the Con-sumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority. Not only elected officials are concerned; the staff and heads of other agencies the Power Authority must work with are digging in their collective heels to op-pose Power Authority overtures. Tom Hannigan, di-rector of the Department of Water Resources rebuffed Power Authority board chair David Freeman's pro-posal to have it buy peaker output. California Energy Commission members said they are at policy odds with the Power Authority's siting plans. In an October 4 letter to Freeman, Hannigan said that the Power Authority's power-wind and fossil peakers-is likely too expensive, overblown and not able to respond quickly enough to balancing power needs. "The letters of intent already approved by the Power Authority could far exceed [DWR's] ability to ab-sorb that power given the outlook for net-short need." Freeman assumes that the market for Power Authority power will be via contract, not the spot market. "Selling on the spot market is difficult to finance and risky," said Power Authority spokesperson Amber Pasricha. The Power Authority is the only agency cur-rently in the position of actually being able to acquire new energy as the state's $12.5 billion bond issue to underwrite continued DWR power purchases is in limbo and the California Independent System Operator is still not creditworthy. Still, the Power Authority cannot issue bonds until it has its own economic house in order, and an Assembly investigation might jeopardize that [J.A. Savage]. [

Which further supports Loretta Lynch's response to the Angelides' letter that DA reduces the amount of spot power DWR has to buy.Best,JeffCONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19 Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority) was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval. The Power Authority has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to approve contracts as soon as possible. Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has been resolved. Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or to implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR's credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized the Power Authority cannot sign contracts. Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as well as 400 MW generated by wind. With the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves? Kellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll, provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation. Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State. Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve customers within the State. He believes that the short-term contracts and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply shortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed through Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand side management, renewables and peakers. Power Authority Names William Barry as Chief Financial Officer William Barry was approved as Chief Financial Officer of the Power Authority at its October 19 Board meeting in Sacramento. Mr. Barry currently works for the City of San Francisco, and has worked in the past for the New York Power Authority.

If you think it would be useful, I can back channel to Loretta and find out.  I'm of the view that this letter is more to refute Angelides, so that his wild assertions don't go unanswered in the court of public opinion.  Perhaps the letter should be addressed to Angelides, instead.  On the other hand, I think it is also useful to make it known to the press and the public that the PUC has the regulatory tools, processes, etc. necessary to permit customers broad latitude to manage their own energy needs on the one hand, and ensure that there's not the sort of massive cost-shifting to which Angelides refers on the other.  In the public's view this has been painted as an either/or issue. Either we end direct access, or granny faces death and destruction.  And that's just not the case. In fact, I think it can be argued that the scenario Angelides paints just isn't in the cards, period.  But I may be missing the mark with all this and am open to other views.

It was strongly opposed by industry and defeated.When push came to shove, I can't think of a time he didn't side with the utilities.Even when the Assembly Republicans were doing of good job of bottling up Davis' ridiculous bailout bills in Rod Wright's committee, Pescetti seemed to go along more to tweek the Democrats than to foster competition.And even then, he followed; he didn't lead--other, more junior, members on the committee led.Can't recall a time that he's been there for us.I'd be happy to talk with him, but if we need someone at the Rick level to contact him, that's great, too.

The board of the California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority on Friday selected Berry as its first chief financial officer. He will start in his new position in early November. The authority was established earlier this year as a result of the state's energy crisis, and is charged with promoting energy conservation efforts and increasing California 's capacity to generate electricity . Berry is currently the assistant general manager of finance and administration at the utility commission, which provides water and sewer services to the city and some neighboring counties, as well as hydroelectric power for San Francisco government operations. Berry has been at the SFPUC since 1999, overseeing finance, personnel and training, information technology, and customer service. He also helped develop the commission's long-range strategic plan and 10-year capital improvement program, which may eventually entail requests for voters to approve more than $4 billion in bonds. Berry worked for a start-up Internet company in Palo Alto from 1996 to 1998 before joining the commission. From 1985 to 1996, Berry was an investment banker at Lehman Brothers in San Francisco, specializing in financing municipal and state-owned power, water, and wastewater systems, according to a release from the power authority. He also managed debt financing, financial planning, investment portfolios, and investor relations while a vice president of corporate finance for the New York Power Authority from 1979 until 1985. He helped develop the authority's first conservation program. In his new postion as CFO, Berry will earn $185,000 annually. Calls to Berry and the SFPUC seeking comment were not returned by press time.

Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:They plan to "settle" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison "meet and confer" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.Fielder is also the point person on "getting ESPs paid" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.If you have any questions, let us know.Best,Jeff

Reason I ask is that in the past, when volumes have been low, SoCal's had to "prop up" flows, i.e., keep a minimum at Blythe for "operational reasons" to serve San Diego (they said).  So (just to give them the benefit of the doubt), I was wondering if there might be something to that recently.  Pure speculation, but wondering if you had any info.  Because I certainly can't think of ANY other reason for their behavior.  I'm calling another PUC staffer today to discuss. In the meantime, are we continuing to make the request to SoCal for service?  Might be a good idea to keep doing that.  Best,Jeff

jeff.dasovich@enron.com,jeff.dasovich@enron.com,jeff.dasovich@enron.com,Subject: Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter,Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California agency buying power in lieu of the state's ailing utilities resold electricity in the spot market during the second quarter at an average price of $45 a megawatt-hour, the agency said Wednesday. The announcement by the California Department of Water Resources was an answer to critics who blasted the department this summer for having to resell surplus power for as little as $1 a megawatt-hour because it secured too much electricity under long-term contracts negotiated by the administration of Gov. Gray Davis, the department said. In a press release, the department's California Energy Resources Scheduling division, its power-marketing arm, said it resold 224,871 megawatt-hours, or 1.1% of its total purchases. That power generally was first bought on the spot market or through monthly or quarterly contracts, not the long-term contracts, the department said. Such sales are typical of any power-buying operation, as demand for electricity can vary in unpredictable ways, the department said. The DWR is responsible for buying all the power needed by the customers of the state's three main utilities beyond what the utilities generate themselves or have secured under their own long-term contracts - or about one-third of the total. According to the DWR, power secured under Davis' long-term contracts covers one-third to one-half of the electricity it must supply. Short-term deals, such as monthly or quarterly contracts, represent one-third of the portfolio. The rest is bought in the spot market. The state has put its average cost of power under the long-term contracts at 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first five years and 6.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the next five years. Davis has taken heat for locking up too much electricity at high prices. Similarly, the Department of Water Resources has been criticized for amateurish purchasing practices. The DWR releases information on its power transactions quarterly to protect its negotiating position, the department said. The DWR buys power for customers of PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric.

Date      October 25, 2001    Time      07:00 AM - 08:00 AM    Station   CNBC    Location  Network    Program   The Squawk Box              Mark Haines, co-anchor:              Joe Kernen, what's going on?              Joe Kernen, co-anchor:              We've got to shift gears into this Enron situation which              has just been--you've been talking about it quite a bit,              David--how could you not talk about it?  Seventy-six              million shares yesterday, down fifty percent in the last              two weeks.  This is a company with--what?--a hundred              million in revenues.              James Cramer, guest market commentator:              Maybe.              Kernen:  Yeah, right.  Anyone who does any trading in              energy apparently, you know, uses Enron Online, so anything              that destabilizes Enron to a great extent could destabilize              the whole energy trading arena and...              Cramer:  Go ahead, say it!  Say what you're thinking!  No              one has said it yet.  We know the truth.  We believe that              Enron caused a national short squeeze.  They knew every              single number in this gas situation.  They wrecked the              California utility system and profited from it.  That's my              bet.  My bet that this--they had--look, they were the              market maker.  Imagine if Instinet knew what you were going              to be buying and took it ahead of you.  I think they              cornered the market for electricity for about four months,              made a huge fortune and now the company is unraveling and              when someone--when the Justice Department gets in there              we're going to discover this.              Kernen:  Let's see what happened...              Haines:  Now, wait a second...              David Faber, co-anchor:              Whoa, whoa, whoa!  The Justice Department, Jim?  Now, is              that new?  Is that something--              Cramer:  No, that would be, if I were a prosecutor,              something...              Faber:  OK, so they are not being investigated?              Cramer:  Well, no, I'm actually being a little forward              thinking.              Kernen:  The SEC wants documents about the limited              partnership transactions of Mr.--              Faber:  Which is very different from what Jim is talking              about.              Cramer:  No, I'm saying that this is what, if I were an              enterprising prosecutor, I would say, Did we have a              nationwide short squeeze in electricity caused by one              company that had access to all the screens and knew exactly              what was happening with the electricity market which then              wrecked the California utility system, cost the consumer              billions of dollars, and is now being hushed up?              Kernen:  Well, let's talk about the actual news.  Here's              yesterday's trading--              Haines:  Wait a minute.              Kernen:  Well, I just want to say that the guy is gone now.              That's the new news here.  Did you read--did you know that              Fastow, after four--              Faber:  Late yesterday.              Kernen:  Yeah, after four o'clock, Fastow is gone.  What's              interesting--              Faber:  He's the CFO--              Kernen:  But he's a new CFO.              Faber:  --who benefitted personally from some of these              off balance sheet partnerships.              Cramer:  Mark, you know, I'm not on thin ice here, I'm not              on thin ice.              Haines:  I just want to make sure we understand that this              is your theory.              Cramer:  This is my theory.              Haines:  OK.              Cramer:  It is just a theory.  It is my opinion.  But I              think we've got to find out more about that short squeeze              that occurred.              Haines:  OK.              Cramer:  We need to find out whether it was orchestrated.              Kernen:  The new CFO might help regain some credibility for              the company because he was the old treasurer who left that              position a year or so ago because of some disagreements              with how Mr. Fastow was doing business apparently.  So now              he's back as CFO and we'll whether that calms the market              down.              Faber:  Well, what they need to do-- Joe, they need to come              clean.  I mean, that is what all the investors in Enron and              those who've left the company as investors over this last              week have wanted.  Let's see everything; be as transparent              as you possibly can be; tell us exactly what we need to              know.  And as much as they need to come clean with their              investors, they need to come clean with their trading              counterparties because that is really what people are              concerned about.              Kernen:  Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big              deal?  Anyone who does trading with them, if their credit              worthiness were to go--if their credit rating were to go              down, how would that affect energy trading?              Faber:  Well, you want to know that they're going to be              there on the other side and make good on the trades.              Kernen:  I guess you would, wouldn't you?              Faber:  Right.  Not that they aren't, but why would you--if              you can trade with seven other guys--seven other companies,              maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there.              Kernen:  Now, why would--              Faber:  And that would hurt their core business.              Kernen:  Why are people expecting some type of action from              the credit agencies, not because of the stock price, right?              Because of something that could unravel--              Faber:  Because of something related to these liabilities              they may have--              Kernen:  That they don't know about at this point.              Faber:  --that they may have with regard to funding some of              these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped              in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at              the off balance sheet partnership.  Will it be a liability?              They don't know.  But that's one of the reasons--              Kernen:  We're talking hundreds of millions or billions?              Faber:  They don't know.              Kernen:  But there were billions of dollars in limited              partners?              Faber:  Yes.  About three billion in financing, I think is              what some analysts estimated.              Kernen:  This is a pretty big number.              Faber:  Yeah, they can get to most of that with the assets              that they have in the partnerships themselves.

Now I'm worried about the              utility average.  I've worried about the transportation              average a lot in my career.

We're breaking below the--              Cramer:  That's a positive, not a negative, Joe.              Kernen:  What's wrong with Cramer today?  What happened?              Cramer:  I'm all fired up!              Faber:  He really is.  My, God, he's got the DOJ getting              all crazy, the FBI, the CIA.  You going down to En--you              going down to Houston yourself?              Cramer:  I may just have to.  I may have to clean up that              whole city.              Kernen:  Jim, why would the--that's the--now getting down              to the lows, I mean, the other averages have come back              quite a bit from the post-attack lows, the utilities are              retesting those.  That's not something to worry about?              Cramer:  No, because I think there's a lot of money going              into more cyclical issues.  I think the economy is showing              signs of getting better.  The consumer is certainly much              stronger than we thought.  The base book didn't say the              corporate was strong, but the consumer is strong.  Much              stronger than before.              Kernen:  All right.  In the past people have worried about              the utility averages being a leading indicator, though.  I              don't--we're talking about four hundred to two-ninety at              this point.  That's a long way.              Cramer:  This average has got a lot of problems to it, but              I still think that--              Kernen:  It's no longer the--              Cramer:  --you sell this as safety.  We don't want safety              as much as we want a little bit more reciprocality.                        # # #

Gray Davis wants to renegotiate several of the state's expensive long-term power contracts -- a move that could translate into a big break for Californians. But the generators who signed the multibillion-dollar contracts to supply the state will be a tough sell on the notion, even though many have indicated they will at least listen to the state. "If the politicians were to make all these contracts go away, ... who the hell is going to meet with the state and negotiate any (new) contracts?" asked Peter Cartwright, president of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., a major supplier of California power. And many experts and analysts are skeptical about Davis' chances of getting generators to substantially lower the price of power they sell to the state, which, in turn, supplies California customers through various utilities. "Good luck!" former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson sarcastically declared upon hearing of the Democratic governor's plan. Davis, however, has suddenly thrust the idea of renegotiating some of the costly power-supply contracts to the center of a wildly complex tangle of fiscal, political and legal issues tied to the energy crisis, the ailing economy and their impact on the growing state budget deficit. The outcome could affect the pocketbooks of energy consumers and taxpayers alike for years, perhaps decades. "This could save billions of dollars," said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, one of the consumer groups that has embraced Davis' power contract renegotiation plan. Barry Goode, Davis' legal affairs secretary, said the administration is "not targeting every contract" because the pacts have been "extremely valuable in keeping the market stable." The governor's aides refused to reveal which generators they will approach or the arguments they intend to use on the companies, whose contracts don't require them to reopen negotiations with the state. The governor signed more than 50 long-term contracts -- worth more than $40 billion -- with about two dozen generators at the height of the energy crisis earlier this year. The state made short-term purchases to supply California after soaring wholesale prices shattered utilities, then entered the longer-term pacts that provide about a third of the state's power demands. The contracts range in duration from a few months to 20 years. Though the contracts provide power at an average $69 per megawatt-hour over the next decade, the current market has dropped to less than half that rate. And the contracts provide more electricity than the state needs at times, forcing California to sell the excess at multimillion-dollar losses. The long-term contracts, harshly criticized by Republicans seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination, have become a political liability for Davis as he heads into a re-election bid next year. The liability is compounded due to the pacts' potential role in what experts at a recent economic summit at Stanford University termed a brewing "perfect storm" of fiscal calamities. The state Public Utilities Commission, principally citing a desire for less costly power, has refused to allocate a revenue stream -- generated from recent electricity rate hikes and anticipated bond proceeds -- to finance the long-term contracts. The standoff has pitted Davis and Democratic state Treasurer Phil Angelides against another of the state's most powerful Democrats, Senate leader John Burton of San Francisco, who sided with the Democratic-controlled PUC. Burton has called "for Californians to be freed from egregious, unreasonable and expensive provisions contained in these contracts." The deadlock is holding up a $12.5 billion bond sale intended not only to help fund California's future power costs but repay state coffers for the billions of dollars spent earlier this year on emergency, short-term electricity purchases. It would be the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history. Without the bond issue, a projected general fund deficit of up to $14 billion next year could grow to a staggering $20 billion-plus, forcing Draconian cuts in essential government services, according to state finance officials. The projected deficit of up to $14 billion in California's annual budget of about $100 billion stems from lagging tax revenue in a cooling economy, further chilled by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast. Against the backdrop of fiscal woes, analysts said successful renegotiation of some long-term power contracts could conceivably wind up sparing Californians electricity rate hikes, tax increases or both. But some analysts are pessimistic, like Wilson. The former governor is widely blamed for legislation that triggered the energy crisis, and yet he in turn blames Davis for not acting quickly enough to head off power woes. The Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing suppliers and brokers, has made it clear generators will expect the state to give them something substantial in return for any changes in the pacts. Such incentives might include settling disputes over power buys or the state dropping lawsuits against suppliers. "We're not going to say no. We'd certainly sit down at the table with them and say, 'Let's see, maybe we can do this, maybe we can do that,'" said Calpine's Cartwright. If state officials simply broke some of their contracts, not only would penalties be "very, very severe," but also "they would have completely blown their credibility, and no one would negotiate with them," Cartwright said. His comments coincided with reports that Calpine's third-quarter profits more than doubled, despite a sharp drop in short-term electricity prices in California, one of its main markets. Analysts said Calpine's performance can be largely attributed to its long-term contracts with the state. Heller, one of the state's most vocal consumer advocates, said Davis "is right to look back at the environment in which these contracts were signed and demand that the power companies come to the table and renegotiate, or even throw out many of the contracts." "Last spring," Heller said, "power companies had a gun to the governor's head and, with staff that already had conflicts of interest, the administration signed some terrible deals."

So while Edison is making good noises about wanting to settle (which is a certainly a step in the right direction), it's still unclear whether they intend to attach terms to the deal that make the whole thing a nonstarter.Got a call into John Fielder to try to get answers to some of these questions.Will report back when (and if) we get some answers.Best,Jeff

FYI--this new schedule was discussed a lot last week, and apparently was a big part of the meeting that occured with Davis' people and Angelides last Thursday nite.  It was a move to buy time to try and get a comprehensive settlement in place in the legislature (i.e., core/noncore). In addition to buying time to save Direct Access, it also gives Angelides more time to get the bonds lined up, which seems to be an increasingly challenging task---there's growing speculation that the issuance will be much more difficult than Angelides has thus far let on. That said, I need to check around, but there is some chance that the plan/agreement is that the PUC decisions would go out well in advance of August (with effective date being August), which would then provide enough time to let the expedited "appeals process" under (SB37?) run its course in time for the issuance in Sept/Oct.  In short, we'll need to remain vigilant energized because there's a chance that the decisions to which Angelides refers in the memo could be up at the Commission sooner rather than later.  This is what I was hearing last Friday, but perhaps things have changed and now there's more time.   I'll check and report back.Finally, simultaneous with those actions, folks are supposed to be putting the core/noncore agreement into legislative language.  I'll report back as soon as I have more information on that.Best,Jeff	Susan J Mara 07/03/2001 11:27 AM 	   To: Michael Tribolet/ENRON@enronXgate, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Paul Kaufman/Enron@EnronXGate, Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRON  cc:   Subject: Angelides Investor Memo - Timetable Update -- says CPUC vote not needed until mid August	The memo to investors says that a new law will take effect on Aug 13 that puts in place shortened appeal times at the CPUC.

In the current market, hedges (longer term contracting and financial) are being done primarily by the producers and marketers, which results in a thin and probably off-kilter market (the LDCs buying for the customers are not participating).  I know we have to square this with the EES positions, but I am not up to speed on what is going on in CA on this issue.Phillip also made that point that while the LDCs are focusing on their core load, no one is doing system planning on the macro basis, taking into account the ability of the physical systems to meet the needs of all customers, core and non-core and making sure the system will be adequate.Finally, he is very interested in seeing the CA LDC rates unbundled.Any updates we can provide to Phillip (and the gas girls) would be appreciated, as well as what our plans are to address these issues.From our side, El Paso is having a conference in July and we will be taking up a number of allocation and transportation issues at that time.Thanks.

Thus if the wording gets changed to "who are taking delivery as of the effective date of this legislation" we have failed.Positive is that it removes the CPUC (anti enron) discretion.2) 1st Base Strategy: The following change: c) The commission shall conduct such proceedings as it deems necessary to inform the public of the revenue requirements  and to establish rates to enable the department to recover the revenue requirement.  Such rates will be designed  i) such that the bond revenue requirements will be recovered, and ii) to reflect the amount of DWR bond costs that the customer or customer class caused.Risk is that the CPUC will interpret these words unfavorably to us.  ie.  If we touch the system once we pay the whole surcharge.Scott---------------------- Forwarded by Scott Stoness/HOU/EES on 07/03/2001 09:14 AM ---------------------------Scott Stoness07/03/2001 08:40 AMTo:	Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enroncc:	Don Black, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, James W Lewis/HOU/EES@EES, Dennis Benevides/HOU/EES@EES Subject:	Draft Bond Legislation LanguageHarry.  I read through the proposed legislation.  In summary it:Imposes a DWR Bond surcharge applicable to all electric power delivered in California .... subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.The commission would approve the adjustments to the DWR Bond Charge as may be necessary to ensure timely recovery....The commission would conduct hearings to establish rates to allow the DWR to recover their revenue requirements.The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be padi from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001.Although we could live with this legislation the issues I see are:IBM would not escape a surcharge even though they may not have caused any DWR costs.SImilarly, large San Diego customers, who have not caused any DWR costs, would be subject to a surcharge.I am having a hard time understanding what they intended to achieve with the clause "The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be paid from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001."Does the 2nd half of this sentence freeze the Jul 31, 2001 rates until the bond is paid off; orIs it just an attempt to define that rates should not go up to pay for the bonds; or [this is the most likely meaning in my mind]Is it just defining that the act comes into effect on July 31, 2001If it is possible, we should advocate:Regarding, SDG&E, customers who did not contribute to DWR costs:Imposes a DWR Bond surcharge applicable to all electric power delivered in California .... subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.The commission would conduct hearings to establish rates to allow the DWR to recover their revenue requirements.  Such rates will be designed  i) such that the bond revenue requirements will be recovered, and ii) to reflect the amount of DWR costs that the customer or customer class caused.And we should get a legal interpretation of  "The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be paid from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001."  To make sure that we are not going to get surprised.Scott

The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too.I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds. In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.  For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st.Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the "core/noncore" proposal.Best,Jeff

From today's Post.  Davis seems to continue to put distance between himself and the contracts.Best,Jeff**********************************************************************Financial California Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy TalksPeter Behr  07/06/2001 The Washington Post FINAL Page E01 Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. "We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion," Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. "You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion." The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close to the negotiations. Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. "What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood," Wagner told reporters. "In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment." The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides, is closed to the public and media. Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a "joke" that the parties might as well wear "clown suits," according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure, some energy analysts believe. Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile "spot market" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so did the state's electricity bills. In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy analysts say. A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a "refund" because the deals were reached "under commercial duress," according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. "There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be," said Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a "just and reasonable" standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. "It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate," said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room "billions of dollars apart," as the talks approached their final weekend, sources said.

Daschle's aides and party strategists say =the Senate's top Democrat wants to keep the White House on the defensive, d=raw attention to popular Democratic goals such as promoting conservation an=d alternate power sources, and inoculate his party against Republicans' cha=rges that it has ignored the country's energy needs. Activists on both side=s see potential for compromises that would lead to legislation Bush can sig=n. =09=09   "With summer, and gas prices, and air conditioning -- this is what you g=o with," said Democratic pollster Fred Yang. "It's an issue that people act=ually live every day. There are very few issues like that in politics."  De=mocrats think the energy issue has become an albatross for the White House.= Recent polls show that a majority of the public disapproves of the way Bus=h is handling energy and environmental issues.  What's more, the House of R=epresentatives voted to block the administration from drilling for oil and =gas off Florida's gulf coast and in the Great Lakes. Both measures passed w=ith support from 70 Republicans.  "When the Republican-controlled House sou=ndly rejects key components of the president's energy policy, it signals an= opportunity to build a bipartisan consensus that begins in the center," sa=id Daschle spokeswoman Anita Dunn.  The decision to highlight energy policy= came late last week after Daschle met privately with his chairmen of key c=ommittees. Democrats present also called for action on raising the minimum =wage, hate-crimes legislation, a prescription-drug plan for seniors and oth=er issues popular with their supporters.  But concentrating on energy polic=y first gives Democrats an opportunity to seize what has been a Republican =issue and turn it to their advantage, aides said.  Bush and Vice President =Dick Cheney are dogged by their backgrounds as former Texas oilmen. From th=e moment Cheney argued for more oil and gas production to satisfy the energ=y needs of the United States, Democrats portrayed Bush and him as beholden =to special interests.  "The White House and Republicans are in the 35 perce=nt end of public opinion on this," a top Democratic leadership aide, who sp=oke on condition of anonymity, said this week. "It's a loser every day for =the Republicans."  With that in mind, Daschle and Sen. Jeff Bingaman, the N=ew Mexico Democrat who heads the Senate's energy and natural resources comm=ittee, plan to have a comprehensive energy bill ready by the end of July. I=t will be a full- scale alternative to the Bush-Cheney program unveiled in =May.  The first floor disputes on energy policy could occur as early as nex=t week, when the Senate debates the spending bill for the Interior Departme=nt. Republicans and White House lobbyists will have their hands full fendin=g off Democratic amendments to match the House bans on offshore drilling ne=ar Florida beaches and on national monument lands.  The White House helped =defuse some of the oil-exploration dispute earlier this week by scaling bac=k its plans to drill in the Gulf of Mexico. But huge disagreements remain o=ver drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a centerpiece of =Bush's energy plan. Some Democrats intend to offer an amendment to the Inte=rior spending bill that would prohibit drilling in the refuge.  Democrats a=lso want to highlight energy conservation and lower emissions of pollutants= that contribute to global warming. One proposal, which combines conservati=on and anti- pollution goals, would raise gas-mileage requirements for spor=t utility vehicles. The National Academy of Sciences is studying fuel econo=my standards and is expected to issue recommendations to Congress later thi=s month.  The energy debate also splits Senate Republicans, giving Daschle =extra manpower to challenge Bush. Democrats can count on New England Republ=icans such as Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Olympia Snowe and Susan Co=llins, both of Maine, to back several Democratic initiatives.  Sen. John Mc=Cain, R-Ariz., who already has opposed Bush on the patients' bill of rights= and campaign finance legislation, also has said he favors more conservatio=n measures than the White House proposes.  "He'll be very prominent in cobb=ling a centrist coalition on the issue," said Marshall Wittman, a senior fe=llow at the conservative Hudson Institute research center and a political a=dviser to McCain. "You can already see the outlines of that proposal -- enc=ouragement of conservation, some exploration, but everything is environment=ally friendly."  The White House already has reacted to the criticism of it=s energy policies. Its budget proposal earlier this year cut research spend=ing for renewable energy, but Bush restored some of the money later. He als=o has paid more attention to energy conservation, indicating support for sp=ending on efficiency measures beyond what he sought in his budget.  But the= president is not backing away from his position that the United States nee=ds to become less dependent on foreign oil. And that, White House officials= say, requires more oil and gas exploration in the United States. The energ=y plan Bush sent to Congress last week would authorize drilling in the Alas=kan wilderness refuge and would use money from the drilling leases to pay f=or research into alternative energy sources.  In addition to public disappr=oval of his stands on the environment and energy, the president is losing t=he sense of urgency that initially accompanied his energy proposals. Rollin=g blackouts in California are on the wane, gasoline prices are falling and =last week John Browne, the chief executive of BP oil, dismissed Bush's call= for new oil refineries.  That gives Democrats a chance to seize the issue =and attack the president without competing pressure from the public for qui=ck solutions.  "It's a target of opportunity," said Burdett Loomis, a polit=ical scientist at the University of Kansas and an expert on the Senate. Lik=e the patients' bill of rights, on which the public sided with Democrats, e=nergy right now "is low-hanging fruit," he said.  =09

The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too.I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds. In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.  For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st.Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the "core/noncore" proposal.Best,Jeff

The purpose of the meeting was to brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution for California.  Here's a summary of the meeting.  Please keep confidential.Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in legislative language.  (We will be in the room.)Work done by the "Plan B" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) will also be put into legislative language over the weekend.Because no proposal is "comprehensive," a complete legislative package will be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., core/noncore, "Plan B," Edison MOU)In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address (e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is what Hertzberg's shooting for. To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a "conference committee," comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th.July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be suspended, etc.The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 15th.  (The PUC will actually issue a "thought piece" on Monday the 9th and will use reactions to the "thought piece" to craft the develop the proposed decision it plans to issue on the 16th.)All of this is still up in the air, however.  As of right now, the leader of the Senate (Burton) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process.

The Senate adjourned early Saturday morning, closing out both the regular session and the second extraordinary session.The Assembly adjourned a few hours later, closing the regular session, but NOT the second extraordinary session.The Legislature's options: 1) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, they continue with the second extraordinary session, and pick up where they left off with the bills they were working on up till Saturday morning.2) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, the Assembly ends the second extraordinary session, they begin a third extraordinary session, and the bills that were left hanging on Saturday morning must start the process from scratch.  However, they can pass a "waiver," which effectively would allow them to start a 3rd session AND then pick up where they left off on Saturday morning.3) The Governor calls them back in two weeks and the Legislature meets briefly and shuts down without doing anything, i.e., the Govenor can call them back, but he can't make them vote.In short, the Legislature has a significant amount of discretion to do what they please.Where to from here?Through its actions on Saturday morning, the Senate has sent a strong signal to Davis that the Senate is not inclined to vote out an Edison bailout that differs from the version it passed prior to leaving for summer recess last July.Just before closing down on Saturday, the Senate also passed a resolution declaring that "...the condition of electric service in California no longer consitutes a 'sudden and severe energy shortage'" and "...that the state of emergency proclaimed by the Governor on January 17, 2001, is at and end."  The resolution seems to send an additional signal that the Senate does not see any great need to bail out Edison.  The Assembly did not pass the resolution, however.  Given the Senate's view, and the open hositility between Davis and Burton, Davis' only remaining option seems to be to threaten the Senate with vetoes unless the Senate first passes the Davis' Edison bill.  It is unclear at this time whether Davis would play it that tough.With the Legislature gone, the action turns to the PUC, where a vote on DA suspension is scheduled for Thursday.  We are working with customers and providers to stop DA from being suspended, or at a minimum, to ensure that any suspension date is not retroactive.Finally, Burton held a news conference this morning at which he said:Burton and Senator Bowen (Bowen's been taking the lead on DA in the Senate) will ask the California PUC to do a study on how DA can be retained without "adversely affecting homeowners and small businesses."He doesn't know why "the Governor would waste taxpayers' money to hold a special session."With all the troubled businesses in California right now, he doesn't know why the State would bail Edison out and not the others.If all this sounds ridiculous, it is.We'll report back with additional information as we get it.Best,Jeff

As part of the contract modification, the $267 million, with interest, that the utility, a unit of PG&E Corp , owes Calpine in past due receivables under the contracts, will be elevated to "administrative priority status," a claim which is paid before any other general unsecured creditors. Calpine will get the money, in a lump sum, as soon as PG&E has a confirmed reorganization plan, which can take as long as four to six months from now, Calpine said. The move is also a step in the process of untangling California's energy crisis, which stemmed from a flawed deregulation plan that has hit the state with a series of rolling blackouts. Under the agreement, Calpine will continue to receive its contractual capacity payments, but it has also set up a fixed rate contract for the next five years of about 5.37 cents per kilowatt-hour. The contracts are known as qualifying facility contracts because Calpine's power plants are qualifying facilities. These types of facilities represent more than 20 percent of the state's power supply and sell power generated from renewable energy sources to the regulated utilities. "Calpine is the first power company to modify its QF contract with PG&E to ensure that Northern California consumers will continue to benefit from these affordable and reliable energy resources," Calpine senior vice president James Macias said in a statement.

Gray Davis will begin a series of radio ads next week defending his handling of the energy crisis -- further proof that political campaigning has become a permanent sport. Davis political adviser Garry South said the ads are designed to fill an "information void" among Californians about what the state has accomplished. But they are playing statewide just as millions of dollars of TV ads financed by Republicans and power companies are attacking Davis. "The campaign season has started early," said Rob Stutzman, a consultant with the state GOP, which has not been involved with the anti-Davis TV spots running since June 19. Davis' 60-second radio spot takes the form of an "energy update," where the governor informs listeners that "we" have licensed 16 new power plants, including three Davis opened this month, and that "conservation is the best way to fight back against high energy prices." Davis' ads convey the same information as a series of state-financed "Flex Your Power" ads run by the Department of Consumer Affairs, only those ads don't mention Davis. Davis' campaign fund, worth well above $25 million, is paying for the $150,000-per-week radio spots to avoid accusations he is using state money to finance his political ambitions. South dismissed the notion that the radio ads came in response to the TV ads that make Davis a target, saying the governor's poll numbers are actually going up. He said people laughed at the ads attacking the governor as ridiculous, particularly one showing Davis in Red Square. "One of the reasons we chose this ('energy update') tack," South said, "is that people simply are not in the mood to have some full-out firefight and some partisan battle about this problem. They are in a just-the-facts-ma'am mood." Stutzman said he didn't disagree with South about the ill-timed and partisan nature of the TV ads, which are financed out of Washington, D.C., but he said the governor is also launching a political firefight of his own. "These ads, even though the the first iteration of them sound like public service ads, very much are political ads," Stutzman said. "The reason they may be poor political ads is they use the governor's voice, and I don't think he has any credibility on this issue." Davis already has updated his 2002 campaign Web site, www.gray-davis.com, which includes an odd-looking caricature of the governor and a photo of Davis standing with actor Martin Sheen, who plays a president on the TV show "The West Wing." The Sheen photo dominates the home page. "What we're trying to do with the Web site is have a little fun with it," said South, who declined to say whether Davis would run against President Bush in 2004. Last month, a conservative group with links to Republicans and energy companies began running a series of ads blaming Davis for the energy crisis and saying the state was suffering from "Grayouts." Time magazine reported last month that hundreds of corporations had contributed to the ads attacking Davis, who has accused Texas firms such as Reliant Energy of "unconscionable price-gouging." Reliant, which donated $10,000 to Davis before the energy crisis, has contributed to the anti-Davis advertising effort, according to Time, and the American Taxpayers Alliance hopes to raise as much as $25 million to keep the ads running in California through July. Scott Reed, a former campaign manager for Bob Dole's failed 1996 presidential bid, formed the American Taxpayers Alliance in Washington to raise money for the 30-second ads. He has refused to name his donors, and did not return a call for comment yesterday. Even though the 2002 elections are more than a year away, Republicans are worried they are losing ground in Congress on Bush's energy policy, and Davis' popularity has slipped somewhat in the polls. But the ads mounted by both sides also are designed to change public policy. Davis recently hired former Clinton-Gore campaign and White House strategists Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, and Davis' public presence and political pull dramatically increased. Another conservative group, the 21st Century Energy Project, will begin running TV ads next week in Washington to promote expansion of the energy supply, more drilling and nuclear energy. The $500,000, two-week advertising purchase is being coordinated by Ed Gillespie, a former campaign strategist for Bush and a consultant for Houston's Enron Corp., the world's largest energy trader. Gillespie said yesterday his group wants to promote a "conservative, market- oriented message" about energy, to counteract environmental groups such as the Sierra Club. He said environmentalists aren't addressing the gap between supply and demand, except through strict conservation. "We're trying to shape the debate, because it's been pretty one-sided so far," Gillespie said. E-mail Robert Salladay at rsalladay@sfchronicle.com. ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Page A - 6

The product produced thus far is generally sloppy and ill-drafted and the individual facilitating the group is working tonite to integrate the comments provided and discussions that took place today. He will  distribute a new draft by noon tomorrow (PDT).The plan as it currently stands is to deliver a product to Hertzberg by COB tomorrow (Monday).As expected, some in the group are attempting to "recontract" certain portions of the original deal, but those attempts are generally at the margin.The DWR contracts remain a key impediment to any deal.Senator Burton has still not definitively committed to a conference committee to produce a bill to deliver to Davis.In addition, the legislation to create a dedicated rate component to service the bonds to repay the state budget for power purchased by DWR (and de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts) may be on a slower track than folks thought initially.Will have more information tomorrow on where Burton and the bond legislation stand.Best,Jeff

The ISO wanted Enron to help set the MCP for replacement energy at $91.86, because the ISO was upset that the MCP had dropped to a penny, and now market participants were buying the ISO's excess energy a penny (after having sold it to the ISO for $91 the day before).There are two phone calls.  The first call is the ISO calling to ask us to help it to set the price.  The next call occurs three minutes later and is the ISO calling because we didn't put in the bid.  Our trader told the ISO that he had to "talk to his boss" because he "didn't want to do anything wrong."  Note:  I have just learned a complicating detail:  Coincidentally, our desk did put in a bid for $91.86 for Hour 18, which was what the ISO had requested.  However, the bid had been formulated before the ISO called our desk.Transcription of a telephone conversation between the ISO's Real Time Desk and Enron's Real Time Desk - July 3, 2001, 14:40:50 - 14.43:38Enron:  Enron, this is David [Porter].ISO:  Hi David.  This is Allen at the ISO.Enron:  David: Hi Allen.  How ya doing?ISO:  Allen:  Hold on one sec.  I've got to get something.Unknown:  Stage one at 11.ISO:  Allen:  Hey, I'm on the hour-ahead desk.  Did you guys put a bid in?Enron:  David:  Yes, hang on one second Allen.ISO:  Allen:  Yeah.Enron:  Ryan:  This is Ryan [Slinger].ISO:  Allen:  Hey Ryan, this is Allen at the ISO hour ahead.  Did you guys put a trade in, replacement [energy]?  Not trade, but a bid?Enron:  Ryan:  For which hour, for hour 15?ISO:  Allen:  For hour 16?Enron:  Ryan:  For hour 16, correct.ISO:  Allen:  Can you guys continue to put the price at that?Enron:  Ryan:  At what?  At $91.86?ISO:  Allen:  YesEnron:  Ryan:  Um,?.ISO:  Allen:  This isn't on a recorded line, but we wanted to do that because of some of the things that we are seeing.  It would be good to keep it [the Market Clearing Price for Replacement Energy] at a higher price.  It doesn't matter how many megawatts you  put it at, but we want to clear it at a higher price.Enron:  Ryan:  Wait, you said we're not on a recorded line, or we are?ISO:  Allen:  We're not.  No, we're not, okay.  We already talked to the day-ahead research guy and myself, but we saw you guys clear at $91 and we wanted you, if it's possible, to continue to set that, whether it's 20 MW or whatever you want to put in there.Enron:  Ryan:  Okay, um?..ISO:  Allen:  We want to clear it at that because of some issues we are seeing as far as others that are taking advantage of the market.Enron:  Ryan:  Oh yeah.  Because it had been clearing like at $100, hadn't it?ISO:  Allen:  Not replacement.Enron:  Ryan:  Oh, not replacement?ISO:  Allen:  No.  What happened is that we bought it back?.see, the day-ahead was purchased at like $100 and then what happened is that the hour-ahead . . .a bunch of these  people were buying it back for a penny over the [inter] ties.  They were faking it.  So we wanted to keep the price up high.   Allen and Ryan:  Unintelligible.Enron:  Ryan:  So they were selling it, oh, in the day ahead, and buying it back?.ISO:  Allen:  Buying like 60 bucks. . . trying to make money off of it, then basically they are trying to buy it back at a penny.Enron:  Ryan:  Oh, that's ridiculous.ISO:  Allen:  That's really ticking us off and right now . . .Enron:  Ryan:  That to me signals, that's probably Powerex, isn't it?ISO:  Allen:  There's about four of them right now.Enron:  Ryan:  Shit.ISO:  Allen:  And for the day-ahead for tomorrow, we didn't, we didn't, we took them out.  Basically, we're not allowing  anything over the ties.Enron:  Ryan:  I didn't submit one for 17 or ?.ISO:  Allen:  That's fine.  They'll probably go to a penny and they'll probably get excited and do a bunch, and we'll hopefully cut them off if you can get the next price and the next market at 80 or 91.Enron:  Ryan:  Okay.  All right.  Well, I'll see what I can do.ISO:  Allen:  I appreciate it.  It's actually in the best interest for the State and the ISO [with] what these guys are doing, so we are trying to put a stop to it.Enron:  Ryan: Okay.ISO:  Allen.  Thanks, bye.Transcription of a telephone conversation between the ISO's Real Time Desk and Enron's Real Time Desk - July 3, 2001, 14:46:55 - 14:47:40 (3 minutes later)Enron:  This is Ryan.ISO:  Hey Ryan, its Allen.Enron:  Ryan:  Yeah.ISO:  Allen:  Hey, did you put it in for the next hour?Enron:  Ryan:  For hour 16?ISO:  Allen:  Yeah, no, they already ran 17.Enron:  Ryan:  Oh, I didn't do 17, no.ISO:  Allen:  Well, see, we're gonna run, we're gonna run 18 coming up here in the next fifteen minutes.Enron:  Ryan:  Okay.ISO:  Allen:  If you have any questions, let me know.  I hope you know this is me from the ISO.  I don't know if you think I'm somebody else but you can call me at the hour-ahead desk.Enron:  Ryan:  Well, I mean, I'm talking to my boss right now as far as, because of, you know, I don't want to be doing anything that's wrong.ISO:  Allen:  Yeah? Enron:  Ryan:  Even if it is helping you guys out, if it's wrong, I can't do it.ISO:  Allen:  I know, but if you continue to bid in at, um, the market, that's the best thing to do.  For replacement.  All right.Enron:  Ryan:  Okay, I'll see what I can do.ISO:  Allen:  Thanks, man.

For simplicity, I accepted all the other changes and put mine in strike-out-underline.They are confined to the direct access section, and to the provisions regarding "spot market service" in particular.  Based on our negotiations, I think it's accurate to state that spot market service was never discussed as "an option to elect."  Instead, the language in the agreement states that it is a "backstop," in the event that on any given day a customer's ESP doesn't show up with the power.  In effect, it retains the utility's duty to serve, like the gas side, but does not expose the utility to any risk of cost recovery for the spot service provided.  I've also added provisions which obligate the utility to provide spot market service in the event that at the outset of the program (i.e., the transition date), the customer, for whatever reason fails to elect Term Service or Direct Access Service.  In both cases, the spot services lasts for a maximum of 30 days, after which the customer must choose Term or Direct Access Service.Please take a look at the language.  While I haven't put any "stakes in the ground" up till now, I feel strongly about these changes (for reasons I'm happy to discuss), and if folks have issues with incorporating it into the document, I'd request that we have a very brief call to discuss.  I believe that the language as proposed captures my conversation with Dorothy.In addition, I've also taken a stab at language requested by Delainey, i.e., "what to do about DA in the interm?"  There may be better ways to craft the language, but I took a shot nonetheless.Finally, I'm assuming, based on yesterday's call, that, by delivering this document to the Speaker today, no one is giving their approval, support, or anything else for each and every provision.  I'm not prepared to, and cannot, do that at this time.Thanks again to all for all the effort (and to Dorothy for her patience in hearing me out earlier).Best,Jeff

LOPEZ; DOUG SMITHTIMES STAFF WRITERS07/10/2001Los Angeles TimesHome EditionB-1Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror CompanySACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis, who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records show. During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas & Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292 an hour by the DWP. In fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period. Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour, according to an analysis of the documents. The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencies. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period. "You have to look at the whole picture," Maviglio said. "The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats," he said. "Their profits were 100% to 400% above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are charging us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte." The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first quarter. The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in the first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the state's energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators. Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year. "All the prices were high," he said, noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in mid-January. The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316 in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per hour to $271, the reports show. In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, one of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, a total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour. By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of $330 per megawatt-hour. A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the "vilification of Enron was based on politics, not facts." Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the past, the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on. A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reached Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high. More Power Bought Than Projected Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts, coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices, have begun to tame the state's market. Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May, about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected. Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July. The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well under $100 a megawatt-hour. A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited Davis' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term power contracts with with "moving the California electric energy industry closer to normalcy."Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

I don't understand the meaning of the phrase "or be deemed to elect."  If inserting the phrase serves an important purpose, then perhaps it's appropriate to leave it in.  But we haven't discussed any reason for needing it.  As such, given the last-minute nature of the change, it should be deleted.There is one heckuvalot of detail in the rate-related language that Edison provided that we didn't have a chance to discuss in our negotiations.  It may turn out that it's all fine, but I frankly haven't haven't had the chance to adequately wrap my meager mind around the language, so I just want to let folks know that many more comments on those pieces may pop up from my end in the near term.Finally, I just want to raise a flag on section 25465 (a) (6) regarding the green portfolio standard.

Gray Davis said he was heartened by the judge's belief that California= is due some amount of refund money, rejecting the generators' arguments fo=r no refunds.=20With the 15-day negotiation session nearly moribund, generators and power t=raders had offered up $716 million in proposed refunds in the final days. B=ut Wagner indicated that that would have to be offset by money the state st=ill owes power companies, meaning no cash would actually change hands.=20The judge held out the possibility that at least two parties, including San= Jose-based Calpine Corp., could reach separate agreements with the state.==20"From what I know, it looks like we can reach an agreement," Calpine spokes=man Bill Highlander confirmed Monday. But he said he could not disclose any= details under Wagner's gag order on participants in the negotiations.=20Enron Corp., one of the nation's highest-profile power traders, said Califo=rnia officials killed the talks by never budging from their claims that the= state's consumers deserved at least $8.9 billion in refunds for overcharge=s.=20"These talks never had a chance," said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. "Their =political skins are worth more than $716 million that the taxpayers of Cali=fornia could have used. It was about creating and maintaining a tool for a =witch hunt."=20Of the $716 million compromise offer, $510 million was put on the table by =what Wagner called the "Big Five" generators -- Reliant, Duke, Mirant, Will=iams and Dynegy -- some of whom are under state investigation. Another $125= million was offered by BC Hydro, British Colombia's government utility, wh=ich is not under FERC jurisdiction, and $16.5 million was offered by six Ca=lifornia municipal utilities.=20The Sacramento Municipal Utility District, the state's second-largest munic=ipal utility, also declined to comment on the talks or any settlement amoun=t it may have offered, but said it would outline its position in writing Th=ursday, the judge's deadline for comments on his proposal.=20Consumer advocates and some industry officials said the judge's brief publi=c remarks make it difficult to predict exactly what the impacts could be on= the state's troubled electric scene.=20"If the judge is saying that the refund is topped at a billion that's outra=geous," said Nettie Hoge, head of The Utility Reform Network. "If they're g=oing to start doing some fact finding, hallelujah."=20Hoge said the talks had been unrealistic from the start, because there was =no effort by FERC to determine how high the overcharges had actually been a=nd then work toward a compromise from there.=20The state used a formula calculated by its nonprofit grid operator, the Ind=ependent System Operator, which was attacked by marketers as wildly high ev=en while the state called it conservatively low.=20Joel Newton, representing all five of the big generators, said Monday that =the ISO has consistently based its demand on "sketchy and incomplete" data.==20The face-off between Davis and power merchants began last fall, as wholesal=e electricity costs were soaring and California utilities warned that they =could be driven into bankruptcy.=20The governor said generators and traders took advantage of the state's powe=r shortage to manipulate markets and gouge consumers. Generators said they =followed all laws and were only deriving fair profits in a scarcity situati=on.=20FERC, which entered the picture because by law it has to ensure that electr=icity rates are "just and reasonable," has made repeated, unsuccessful effo=rts to craft a solution that could appease both sides.=20State Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks, said Monday that t=he failure of the settlement talks to agree on a refund figure "comes as no= surprise."=20Negotiators representing generators "refused to even acknowledge the inesca=pable fact that they have profited enormously by exploiting a dysfunctional= market -- at California's expense," he said.=20Davis, who had accused the generators of failing to negotiate in good faith= with state representatives, said that although FERC commissioners have bee=n slow to respond to his requests for refunds and for price caps on wholesa=le electricity, they "now have the opportunity to redeem themselves."=20He suggested the commissioners can opt to award California more than is rec=ommended by the judge.=20Wagner, after mediating talks that continued throughout the weekend, seemed= resigned to the fact that trying to bring more than 50 government, utility= and power generating entities together proved to be an exercise in futilit=y.=20Michael Kahn, head of the California delegation and consultant to the Calif=ornia ISO, nonetheless came away thinking the state had fared pretty well.==20"We came here wanting $8.9 billion," Kahn said. "In all candor, we didn't r=eceive any meaningful settlement offers and so the negotiations were not as= helpful as we had hoped they would be. But our positions were vindicated" =because refunds were offered.=20Meanwhile, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison soun=ded the call for more talks.=20"We're willing to talk to anyone, anytime about a settlement," said Steve P=ickett, general counsel of Southern California Edison. PG&E said in a prepa=red statement that the sessions "provide a solid basis for further negotiat=ions."=20How much money the state might eventually receive remains the big question =mark. Wagner said settlement offers of $716 million suggest that eventual r=efunds will amount to "hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe a billion." B=ut he also stressed that he would recommend no specific figure to FERC comm=issioners and does not know how big refunds might eventually be.=20Other recommendations Wagner said he would make to the commission were a mi=xed bag for the state.=20The judge said he would recommend refunds no further back than Oct. 2, 2000=, an action that Kahn said would immediately slice $3 billion off the state='s refund analysis that stretched back to May 2000.=20But Kahn said that was no defeat for the state, which would turn to the cou=rts to recover that and any other sums excluded from a final refund order.==20"We still have a viable litigation claim for the remainder," Kahn said.=20Brent Bailey, vice president and general counsel of Duke Energy of North Am=erica, said he felt the formula laid out by Wagner would generate a refund =order in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion.=20"It's a reasonable amount in the context of these settlement talks," Bailey= said.=20The Bee's David Whitney can be reached at (202) 383-0004 or dwhitney@mcclat=chydc.com .=20Staff writers Emily Bazar and Dale Kasler contributed to this report.Third power plant opens: But the Los Medanos facility isn't pouring out ele=ctricity yet.=20By Carrie PeytonBee Staff Writer(Published July 10, 2001)=20The flood of new electricity being welcomed by Gov.

The informatio=n was released a week after state Controller Kathleen Connell put out detai=ls of the state's long-term power contracts over the objections of Gov. Gra=y Davis, her political nemesis.=20The state has committed about $8.1 billion to buying power on behalf of Cal=ifornia's crippled utilities, straining the budget surplus and raising ques=tions from lawmakers and others about Davis' policies for resolving the sta=te's energy crisis. In turn, state officials have accused many suppliers of= gouging California to the tune of several billion dollars.=20When it came to the spot market, the water department was at the mercy of a= business run amok. The state paid upward of $300 a megawatt-hour for days =in January and February -- months when electricity normally should be a lot= cheaper. Water officials said prices have dropped to the $100 range largel=y because they've signed a slew of long-term contracts, reducing their depe=ndence on spot sales.=20"Our exposure earlier this year to the spot market was at the maximum," sai=d Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the water department.=20The information released Monday covered the first three months of the year =and didn't include the highest price the water department has paid for elec=tricity: $1,900 a megawatt-hour in May to Reliant Energy Inc., a Texas gene=rator that owns several plants in the state. Duke Energy Corp. of North Car=olina charged even more for power in January, $3,880 a megawatt hour, but t=hat sale was made to the Independent System Operator, which runs the state'=s transmission grid.=20The documents show that while the state's stricken utilities no longer buy =power for themselves, their sister companies have sold expensive power.=20Through May 31, the state paid a trading arm of Sempra Energy, the parent o=f San Diego Gas & Electric, some $429 million for power. It paid PG&E Energ=y Trading, an unregulated sister company of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., a=bout $23.7 million.=20Among others, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was paid $331 m=illion through May 31; Canadian utility BC Hydro was paid $1.05 billion; At=lanta's Mirant Corp. $1.24 billion; the federal government's Bonne=07ville =Power Administration $167 million; and the Sacramento Municipal Utility Dis=trict $80.7 million.=20Generally, the more desperate the state was for power, the higher the price=s. For instance, Oklahoma-based generator Williams Cos. commanded $565 a me=gawatt-hour March 20, when blackouts struck more than 1 million Californian=s.=20Location also was critical. On March 8 the state paid the PG&E trading unit= $250 but only $180 to Arizona-based Pinnacle West Capital Corp. The differ=ence was that PG&E's power was delivered to energy-starved Northern Califor=nia, while Pinnacle's was sent to Southern California where energy wasn't s=o scarce.=20Split-second timing was also crucial. At 9:09 a.m. Feb. 14, the state paid =$400 to Mirant for power to be delivered the next day.

Energy talks reach no settlement; state threatens suit        By Mark Sh=erman ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 10, 2001  WASHINGTON - With talks between the =state and power generators stalled, California may go to court to help win =the $8.9 billion state officials believe it was overcharged for electricity=.  "I think we have demonstrated very clearly both to the FERC and to the j=udge that the state is owed $8.9 billion and will settle for nothing less,"= said Roger Salazar, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis.  With negotiations at= an impasse, the administrative law judge for the Federal Energy Regulatory= Commission said California is probably owed no more than $1 billion in ref=unds.    "The numbers were too far apart," said Curtis Wagner, the FERC chi=ef administrative law judge.  California, Wagner said, may receive nothing =at all, because generators may be owed more than they have to return for an=y overcharges.  He placed the refunds owed the state at between $716 millio=n and $1 billion. Power providers had offered $716 million as part of an ov=erall settlement, while California state officials sought $8.9 billion, Wag=ner said.  He said California officials had not made the case for $8.9 bill=ion in refunds.  Salazar, however, said the state would go to court and may= ask for $20 billion.  Separately, Wagner split off claims of overcharges f=rom the Pacific Northwest, saying he has not had time to consider those all=egations under the short timetable ordered by FERC last month.  Wagner serv=ed as a mediator during the 15 days of negotiations and will recommend a se=ttlement to FERC by next Monday. The commission ordered the talks last mont=h in an effort to resolve differences between producers and the state over =the breakdown of California's deregulated electricity market.  Consumer adv=ocates assailed the judge's recommendation and urged the state to continue =its attempt to get refunds from what they say are profiteering power compan=ies.  "It's like catching a bank robber, but instead of making him give bac=k all of it, you only make him give back 5 percent of what he stole," said =Douglas Heller, spokesman for the Santa Monica-based Foundation for Taxpaye=r and Consumer Rights.  Power generators, however, were generally pleased w=ith Wagner's comments.  Brent Bailey, general counsel for Duke Energy, said= even if the formula Wagner recommends produces $1.5 billion in refunds, "t=hat's a reasonable amount in the context of these settlement talks."  Calif=ornia officials, negotiating on behalf of utilities, the Public Utilities C=ommission and state power buyers, accused the producers of manipulating sup=ply to unfairly drive up prices.  The producers have acknowledged prices ar=e high, but blame jumps in the price of natural gas, which fuels many power= plants, and the workings of the free market.  The bill for wholesale power= in California soared to $27 billion last year from $7 billion the year bef=ore. Davis has estimated the state could spend as much as $50 billion this =year.  The producers reiterated Monday that California's numbers are grossl=y inflated. Attorneys for the five major generators - Duke Energy, Dynegy, =Mirant, Reliant Energy and the Williams Cos. - said in a statement that the=y have made a "very substantial global settlement offer."  Reliant would ag=ree to no more than $50 million in refunds as part of an overall settlement= that also would have to include protection from additional legal claims, s=aid John H. Stout, a company senior vice president.  But Stout also said, "=Reliant's fundamental position has been and remains that no refunds are jus=tified."              Refunds in jeopardy as talks fail        Judge sees p=ossibility of offsets equal to the billions sought by state By Toby Eckert = COPLEY NEWS SERVICE  July 10, 2001  WASHINGTON -- Settlement talks between= California and power providers accused of electricity price gouging collap=sed yesterday, and the judge who will now hand the case over to federal reg=ulators set a course far from favorable to the state's demand for $8.9 bill=ion in refunds.  "There are refunds due that total hundreds of millions of =dollars and maybe a billion dollars," Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief administr=ative law judge for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said in previ=ewing the recommendations he will make to the commission.  But Wagner, who =mediated the talks, also suggested that power sellers are still owed sums f=or electricity "that probably are higher than any overcharges" for which th=ey may have to pay refunds.  That opened the possibility that California co=uld see no cash refunds, only a reduction in the billions of dollars the po=wer generators and marketers claim they are owed by state entities and util=ities.  Wagner said he would recommend that FERC hold a "fast-track hearing=" to try to untangle the complex financial claims and counterclaims arising= from California's power crisis.  Wagner also outlined a method that he sai=d FERC should use for calculating refunds.  While his proposed formula incl=udes part of one method the state used, it contains several elements for ca=lculating electricity costs that were favored by power sellers, who maintai=n that California's numbers are wildly exaggerated.  "I would suspect that =would result in a number much below $8.9 billion," said Joe Ronan, vice pre=sident of Calpine, a San Jose-based electricity generator. "I think (Wagner='s method) reflects more accurately what actually happened" in the state's =dysfunctional power market.  But Michael Kahn, the state's lead negotiator,= said Wagner "vindicated" California's core arguments.  "The hundreds of pe=ople who came here on the other side had argued to the mediator that there =should not be any refunds, and that position was loudly rejected," said Kah=n, chairman of the organization that manages most of California's power gri=d.  "We think the numbers, even using the judge's formula, are going to be =in the multiple billions. Whatever amount of money . . . is awarded to us, =we will have viable claims in state court and other jurisdictions for the r=emainder. So what we have here is a situation where California will get its= $8.9 billion."  Power sellers acknowledged that the threat of litigation r=emains worrisome to them. They sought an end to investigations of their con=duct, and immunity from legal action as part of their bargaining position. = During two weeks of negotiations ordered by FERC, the two sides came nowhe=re near bridging their differences. Wagner said a number of power sellers h=ad put forward offers that totaled $716.1 million.  "That's a long way from= splitting the difference," he said. "In 15 days, you can't work miracles."=  Yesterday -- the deadline for completing the talks -- the ill will betwee=n the two sides broke into the open as Wagner allowed reporters into the pr=eviously closed hearings.  Each side essentially accused the other of barga=ining in bad faith and failing to put forward realistic proposals.  John H.= Stout, a senior vice president at Reliant Energy Wholesale Group, said the= state used "biased calculations" to arrive at its $8.9 billion refund dema=nd. He also said that Reliant offered to knock $50 million off the $300 mil=lion it claims it is still owed for power sold into the state.  Kahn shot b=ack that Reliant made the offer confidentially to Wagner and never approach=ed the state.  Figures scrutinized "This is the first time we've heard any =of this information. And to give the impression that somehow there's been c=ooperation or forthcomingness, I think is misleading," Kahn said.  The stat=e's refund calculations were scrutinized repeatedly during the talks.  The =$8.9 billion figure emerged from a study by the California power grid opera=tor of charges for electricity between May 2000 and May 2001, a period when= wholesale power prices soared.  Kahn said the figure was essentially dupli=cated when the state went back and calculated what power costs would have b=een if a pricing method instituted by FERC last month had been in effect fo=r the entire yearlong period.  FERC ordered the pricing method in a bid to =tame wholesale prices in the West.  In a partial win for the state, Wagner =said he would recommend that FERC use the order retroactively as a basis fo=r calculating refunds, an approach resisted by the power sellers.  But he s=aid that FERC should only scrutinize charges going back to October 2000, an=d should make several key changes in how power-generating costs are calcula=ted.  For instance, he said, FERC should determine the actual amount of gas= heat it takes to generate a megawatt of electricity and use spot market pr=ices in Northern and Southern California to determine the cost of gas, rath=er than a statewide average cost, computed monthly.  Fewer overcharges? Tho=se and other parts of the complex formula Wagner will recommend could incre=ase the benchmark cost of producing power and drive down the amount of over=charges.  Kahn said that applying FERC's pricing method only back to Octobe=r would put about $3 billion of the state's refund claim off-limits.  Brent= Bailey, vice president and general counsel for Duke Energy North America, =said, "We think (Wagner's) modifications are certainly a vast improvement o=ver FERC's June 19 order and also certainly over (the state's) model."  Ame=rica.  In Sacramento, Gov. Gray Davis issued a statement characterizing the= electricity suppliers as pirates who refused to negotiate in good faith.  ="While in the past the FERC has shown little, if any, interest in consumers=, they now have the opportunity to redeem themselves by returning the $8.9 =billion California has demonstrated it is owed," Davis said.  Despite the h=arsh rhetoric, both sides indicated that they would continue trying to reac=h one-on-one settlements.  Ronan of Calpine said the generator was close to= making a deal with the state. Bailey said that while Duke would continue t=o push for a "global settlement" between all the parties, "We've had seriou=s settlement talks with the state over the last few days and hope to contin=ue."               State's massive outlays detailed        Energy bill exce=eded $100 million on 3 days By Jennifer Coleman  ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 10,= 2001  SACRAMENTO -- On three days in May, California's daily power spendin=g topped $100 million, according to a report released yesterday by state po=wer traders.  The California Department of Water Resources report, which ad=dressed spot market electricity purchases since January, was released along= with 1,770 pages of documents that specifically detailed the first three m=onths of last-minute power purchases.  Such power buys on the spot market t=ypically get the most expensive electricity available.

FERC Judge Says State Owed No More Than $1= Billion From Associated Press  July 9 2001  WASHINGTON -- California is ow=ed no more than "a billion dollars" from power wholesalers, a federal regul=atory judge said today at the end of 15 days of settlement talks in the sta=te's electricity crisis.  Curtis Wagner, the Federal Energy Regulatory Comm=ission's chief administrative law judge, said that at the same time the pow=er suppliers probably are owed more than that.  The net effect of his preli=minary recommendation is that California probably will receive no refunds f=rom wholesalers.  Wagner said power generators had offered $761 million in =refunds. The state has asked for $8.9 billion since May 2000. Wagner said h=e will not recommend refunds for power sales that occurred before Oct. 2.  =It was not immediately clear what impact the judge's preliminary recommenda=tion would have on efforts to settle the dispute.  Both sides said before t=he judge's announcement that they expected a protracted legal battle in the= event the talks did not produce a settlement.  Michael Kahn, Gov. Gray Dav=is's representative in the talks, has said the state would seek more than t=wice the claimed overcharges if the dispute moved from mediated talks to a =courtroom.  The producers reiterated today that California's numbers are gr=ossly inflated. Attorneys for the five major generators-- Duke Energy, Dyne=gy, Mirant, Reliant Energy and the Williams Cos.-- said in a statement that= they have made a "very substantial global settlement offer."  John H. Stou=t, a senior vice president for Reliant Energy, said his company would agree= to no more than $50 million in refunds, as part of an overall settlement t=hat also would have to include protection from additional legal claims.  Bu=t Stout also said, "Reliant's fundamental position has been and remains tha=t no refunds are justified."  FERC ordered the talks last month in an effor=t to resolve differences between producers and the state over the breakdown= of California's deregulated electricity market.  The state has accused the= producers of manipulating supply to unfairly drive up prices. The producer=s have acknowledged that prices are high, but blame jumps in the price of n=atural gas, which fuels many power plants, and the workings of the free mar=ket.  The bill for wholesale power in California soared to $27 billion last= year from $7 billion the year before. Davis has estimated that the state c=ould spend as much as $50 billion this year.  ----  On the Net:  Federal En=ergy Regulatory Commission: http://www.ferc.fed.us/   Copyright 2001, Los A=ngeles Times       Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power: Many suppl=iers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried, records show. RI=CH CONNELL and ROBERT J. LOPEZ and DOUG SMITHS TIMES STAFF WRITER  July 10 =2001  SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more divers=e group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davi=s, who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records =show.  During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretch=es of power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and privat=e entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid= to Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by =the Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.  Am=ong those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per meg=awatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas & =Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Powe=r, the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour =charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292= an hour by the DWP. In fact, some of the biggest private power companies s=ingled out for criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., D=uke Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid =for the period. Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 pe=r megawatt-hour, according to an analysis of the documents.  The figures co=ver the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased by the state =during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month o=f razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencies.  Davis spok=esman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at p=rivate out-of-state generators because, in general, they have reaped the hi=ghest profits over the longest period.  "You have to look at the whole pict=ure," Maviglio said.  "The governor was expressing his displeasure with the= arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats," he said. "Their profits= were 100% to 400% above last year. . . . Just because there are other enti=ties who are charging us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact t=hat we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or =Charlotte."  The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided t=o The Times on the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on =California's electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year='s first quarter.  The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion= buying power in the first five months of the year, and underscore the comp=lexity of the state's energy problem. They also show that patterns of high =prices are not limited to a few generators.  Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for= the water resources agency, said that the reports together show that price=s were extremely volatile early in the year. "All the prices were high," he= said, noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying pow=er in mid-January.  The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purch=ases went from $316 in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an ave=rage of $321 per hour to $271, the reports show.  In the first quarter of t=he year, some public entities' prices far exceeded those of the biggest pri=vate companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, one of the nation's bigge=st power traders, charged an average of $181 per megawatt-hour. And Atlanta=-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, a total of $706 million, c=harged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour.  By contrast, a Calgary, Canad=a, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a megawatt-hour, and the Sacrament=o Municipal Utility District had average charges of $330 per megawatt-hour.=  A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the "vilification =of Enron was based on politics, not facts." Spokesmen for BC Hydro could no=t be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the =past, the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered= last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on.  =A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, s=aid late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see= the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reac=hed Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of produc=ing the power needed by the state were extremely high.  More Power Bought T=han Projected  Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agen=cy's efforts, coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falli=ng natural gas prices, have begun to tame the state's market.  Still, the s=tate had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May, about 10% more= than Davis' analysts had projected.  Hidlago said that was because of hot =weather in May and other supply problems in April. He said reports will sho=w that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early Ju=ly.  The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in =June and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to wel=l under $100 a megawatt-hour.  A summary Department of Water Resources repo=rt released Monday credited Davis' program of nurturing new power generatio=n and establishing long-term power contracts with with "moving the Californ=ia electric energy industry closer to normalcy."  Copyright 2001, Los Angel=es Times       Duke Energy Asked to Allow Release of Data Power: Senator sa=ys the generator is refusing to make public some information crucial to the= price-gouging probe. Firm says it's complying. CARL INGRAM TIMES STAFF WRI=TER  July 10 2001  SACRAMENTO -- The chairman of a Senate committee probing= suspected price gouging during the California energy crisis charged Monday= that Duke Energy is refusing to allow him to make public information key t=o his investigation.  Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) said Duke has made the pr=ice bidding information from its Chula Vista plant available to committee m=embers and staffers. But under a federal confidentiality rule, the data can=not be made public without Duke's consent.  The documents concern the Chula= Vista plant, which former employees have alleged was ramped up and down to= drive up power prices during three days in January. However, state records= show that the agency overseeing the electricity grid ordered those gyratio=ns to keep the power flowing throughout the state. Dunn said Duke's refusal= thwarts the committee's investigation and efforts to enact possible remedi=al legislation because the confidential information cannot be shared with o=thers in the Legislature or the public.  Dunn said Duke cited a rule of the= Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that gives the company the authority =to decide which records it makes public and which stay secret.  "The only o=ne who can release the data is Duke. We agreed to be bound by what is provi=ded in the FERC tariff, nothing more or less," he said.  Former Employees T=ell of Maneuvers  Dunn noted that the committee is considering trying to ob=tain the information elsewhere and "release it over Duke's objections."  Th=ree former workers at the Duke plant near Chula Vista testified last month =under oath that the plant, among other things, was ramped up and down in wh=at seemed to be an effort to maximize revenue during the Jan. 16-18 emergen=cy.  But Duke countered immediately that it had merely obeyed orders of the= California Independent System Operator, which keeps the state's electricit=y grid in balance. Duke later provided Cal-ISO documents backing up its exp=lanation.  Duke executives insisted that the former employees failed to pro=vide a full picture of the plant's operation during the three days.  But Du=nn, chairman of the select Senate committee on alleged price gouging, said =Monday that by refusing to authorize release of all the subpoenaed data, Du=ke was guilty of the same tactics.  "Duke is trying to draw the impression =that it has [provided] the full picture. But they are fully aware that we c=annot draw any final conclusions until all that data has been released. Tha=t hasn't occurred," Dunn said.  To make a determination whether the Chula V=ista power was withheld to drive up prices, Dunn said, the committee must p=ublicly examine "the bids Duke submitted from which the ISO issued orders t=o the plant." They include the expensive hour-ahead and day-ahead markets, =he said.  Duke, a North Carolina-based wholesaler that operates several pla=nts in California, noted that it considers the information proprietary and =off-limits to legislators not on the committee.  Duke spokesman Tom William=s insisted that the generator is attempting to comply with the committee's =demands. But he was unable to say whether Duke would agree to make the bidd=ing documents public along with other records the committee plans to turn o=ver.  "We are complying now," Williams said. "There is some suggestion that= we are leaving stuff out when we have not had a chance to testify. . . . I= don't know what we are ultimately going to do."  The committee had threate=ned to cite eight wholesale generators unless they provide pricing and bidd=ing documents by Wednesday. Six, including Duke, have said they would compl=y to avoid a contempt citation. Two, Enron and Mirant, were cited.  Dunn sa=id the committee on Wednesday likely will give companies that are trying to= comply an extra week to do so, but others probably will be formally charge=d with contempt in a report to the full Senate. The upper house is the fina=l arbiter of such issues.  Although there is scant precedent for levying pe=nalties against those cited for contempt, Dunn said he favors imposing seve=re fines. In 1929, the most recent case, a cement company executive was sen=t to jail.  Copyright 2001, Los Angeles Times        NEWS ANALYSIS Concern =Over Price of Long-Term Power Pacts Grows Embedded costs may yield more rat=e hikes, critics say, and the $43-billion total could complicate plans to r=escue Edison. DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITER  July 9 2001  SACRAMENTO -- Eve=n as the summer progresses without blackouts, and Gov. Gray Davis prepares =for yet another news conference today to symbolically switch on a new power= plant, the work in the Capitol has shifted to the seemingly more daunting =task of balancing the books.  It's a task with potentially far more long-la=sting implications for state coffers, for businesses' bottom lines and for =consumers' wallets.  In particular, long-term power contracts trumpeted by =the governor's office as helping to bring stability to California's out-of-=control electricity market are having the opposite effect politically. A gr=owing concern about the $43-billion price tag of the contracts is complicat=ing one of Davis' most ambitious energy initiatives: a proposed financial r=escue of Southern California Edison, which already faces an uncertain fate =in the Legislature. Questions about the contracts come as California readie=s a complex $13.4-billion bond sale to reimburse the state's general fund f=or other power purchases.  Critics worry that costs embedded in the contrac=ts, on top of the billions needed to pay for the Edison rescue, could lead =to additional electricity rate hikes for consumers. Key lawmakers, consumer= advocates and business lobbyists are urging that at least some of the pact=s be renegotiated.  Citing a recent plunge in wholesale energy costs, these= critics say the state should work to shorten the duration of the contracts= and lower some of the prices. They argue that the state entered into the d=eals under duress after California's utilities neared insolvency and the st=ate Department of Water Resources took over the purchasing of electricity f=or more than 25 million residents.  "They are vulnerable," Senate Energy Co=mmittee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) said of deals the state s=truck with independent power companies when prices were at record highs.  B=owen lauds Davis administration negotiators for signing "the best deals the=y could." But she said that in the crisis atmosphere in which the negotiati=ons took place, "the state had two cards and the generators had 50."  Contr=acts Open to Challenges  The contracts could be challenged in court or, mor=e immediately, before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washingto=n. There, an administrative law judge could direct that the pacts be rework=ed as part of a settlement of allegations by Davis that generators overchar=ged the state for electricity by $8.9 billion.  "We ought not to say, 'Fine=, the contracts were the best we could do,' " Bowen said.  For his part, Da=vis says he is willing to accept partial payment of the $8.9 billion in the= form of contracts with terms more favorable to the state. He attributes th=e recent sharp drop in wholesale electricity prices to conservation, the ad=ministration's effort to increase power supply and--a major factor--the lon=g-term contracts, which slashed the state's reliance on the volatile daily,= or spot, market.  "You can see the value of these long-term contracts . . =. dramatically shrinking our overall price, which is what matters to Califo=rnians," Davis said, pointing out that the average cost of power plunged 30=% from May to June.  Davis energy advisor S. David Freeman, who helped nego=tiate the contracts, said they may end up costing less than $43 billion, gi=ven the recent decline in prices for natural gas, the main fuel for Califor=nia's electricity-generating plants.  Freeman also compared critics to some=one who calls the fire department to douse a blaze. "After the fire is out,=" he said, "you complain about the water damage."  The contracts have other= defenders, among them UC Berkeley economics professor Severin Borenstein, =who says the deals helped to tame the volatile spot market by reducing gene=rators' incentive to drive up prices, while reducing the state's exposure t=o wild swings in price.  "The point of signing long-term contracts is not t=o get a great price; it's to reduce risk," Borenstein said.  Still, experts= have been picking through the pacts ever since a Superior Court judge in S=an Diego, ruling in a California Public Records Act lawsuit by news organiz=ations and Republican lawmakers, ordered last month that Davis unseal the c=ontracts.  An analysis done for the Assembly by three experts--one each rep=resenting Southern California Edison; the Utility Reform Network, a consume=r group; and large electricity consumers--concluded that the about $43-bill=ion price tag announced by the administration may not account for all the c=osts. When other expenses are factored in--ranging from environmental equip=ment upgrades to any new energy-related taxes--the contracts could cost an =additional 10% to 20%.  "Once the contracts were made public," Senate Repub=lican leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga said, "just about anyone who ca=n read began calling for those contracts to be renegotiated."  As buyers' r=emorse spreads through the Capitol, the contracts increasingly are seen as =a hurdle--or a bargaining chip--as Davis and lawmakers confront fast-approa=ching deadlines in their effort to prevent the energy crisis from morphing =into a broader financial crisis.  A bill pushed by Davis to avert bankruptc=y for the financially hobbled Southern California Edison must be approved b=y Aug. 15. The deadline could be tighter, because the Legislature is schedu=led to adjourn for a monthlong break July 20.  Davis' rescue plan, along wi=th legislative alternatives, languishes in the Legislature. The plan, which= has little apparent support, would require the state to buy Edison's syste=m of transmission lines for $2.76 billion and permit the utility to charge =ratepayers for the rest of its back debt of $3.5 billion.  Some lobbyists a=nd lawmakers believe that the electricity rate hike approved in March by th=e California Public Utilities Commission--at 3 cents a kilowatt-hour the la=rgest in state history--may not be enough. The revenue generated under the =new rate structure must cover the costs of the long-term power contracts an=d repay the planned $13.4 billion in bonds, which would be the largest muni=cipal deal ever.  Whether there would be sufficient money left to pay for t=he Edison rescue remains to be seen. But some experts say the utility may n=eed to seek a separate rate hike to cover its costs.  As written, the contr=acts have few escape clauses; Davis cannot simply walk away from them if he= concludes that prices are too high. Still, criticism persists and crosses =political lines.  Harry Snyder, longtime Sacramento lobbyist for Consumers =Union, and Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Tech=nology Assn., rarely find themselves on the same side of a debate. But in s=eparate interviews, they sounded similar themes.  "If there is a way to buy= our way out of these contracts, even if we have to pay damages, we'd be be=tter off in the long run," Snyder said.  Stewart, like other business leade=rs, does not advocate abrogating the contracts. But like many familiar with= the terms, he hopes that some deals can be renegotiated.  "They are proble=matic," he said.  In a move that critics fear could lock in high electricit=y prices for the next decade, the Davis administration is pushing the PUC t=o agree within a month to limit its authority to question costs incurred by= the Department of Water Resources as it goes about procuring power.  State= Treasurer Phil Angelides said the PUC must act so he can complete the $13.=4-billion bond sale. A binding agreement is necessary so that Wall Street i=nvestors can be assured that they will be repaid.  "The state will be out o=f cash by the end of the year without the bond sale," he said. "We will mov=e toward fiscal insolvency."  The so-called rate agreement, a draft of whic=h was obtained by The Times, would bind customers of the three big regulate=d utilities to pay more than just the principal and interest on the $13.4 b=illion in bonds. Consumers would have to pay for consultants, lawyers, to p=ay taxes, fees and other as-yet-undefined charges that may be incurred by t=he Department of Water Resources.  Additionally, the PUC would be obligated= to approve payments for programs by which the state would pay large and sm=all customers to cut electricity use, although the Legislature has not appr=oved the programs and their details remain to be worked out. The Department= of Water Resources estimates the cost to be $800 million, spread over this= year and next.  "It is loaded up," Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D=-San Francisco) said of the proposed rate deal, adding that it would requir=e the commission to "raise rates to cover whatever the Department of Water =Resources decides to do."  "That is giving a blank check to some bureaucrat=ic office," he said.  'Dictatorial Power' Warning  Stewart of the manufactu=rers group also is alarmed by the plan, saying it would provide the water a=gency with "dictatorial power."  "As skeptical as we are of the PUC process=, at least there is a process," Stewart said, referring to the commission's= procedures to set electricity rates. "There is no process for DWR. DWR jus=t tells the PUC, 'This is what we need,' and the PUC must approve it."  Oth=ers say the rate agreement is a standard piece of work, given the extraordi=nary step the Legislature took in January when it authorized the Department= of Water Resources to buy power for utilities that had fallen so deeply in=to debt that they could no longer carry out their obligation to consumers. = In essence, Davis energy advisor Freeman said, lawmakers in January create=d "the equivalent of a public power purchasing agency" beyond the jurisdict=ion of the PUC.  "There is no public power agency in California that is rev=iewed by the PUC," said Freeman, former head of the Los Angeles Department =of Water and Power.  *  Times staff writer Nancy Rivera Brooks in Los Angel=es contributed to this story.

"There are refunds due (to California) t=hat total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe a billion dollars," Wag=ner said yesterday.  "At the same time, there are sums due to sellers from =the California Independent System Operator and the investor-owned utilities= in the state of California that probably are higher than any overcharges t=hat (the state) may come up with."  Now, it will be up to the federal regul=ators to settle the case. But the recommendations by Wagner, who mediated t=he talks, carry significant weight with the commission and cast doubt on th=e state's chances of collecting the full $8.9 billion it claims to be owed.=  The judge said he will recommend that the commission order new hearings t=o calculate what the state and the power sellers are each owed. The hearing=s would be overseen by an administrative law judge and would last 45 to 60 =days, Wagner said.  CLOSING SESSION Wagner made his comments in the closing= session of the 15-day talks, which were ordered last month by the regulato=ry commission to try to defuse the dispute between power wholesalers and Ca=lifornia officials before it reached the courts.  The judge's message was a= sharp rebuke to the unyielding stand by California leaders -- especially D=avis, who last week said he wouldn't take a dime less than $8.9 billion for= California's consumers.  The governor issued a statement shortly after the= close of talks insisting that California had won its basic case that the s=tate is owed refunds.  "I am pleased that Judge Wagner accepted our methodo=logy for calculating refunds and rejected the generators' position that no =refunds are due," Davis said.  The governor's chief representative at the t=alks, Michael Kahn, called the judge's statement a "ringing endorsement" of= the state's call for refunds. Kahn said the judge's order would improve th=e state's legal position if it files suit against power sellers.  GENERATOR=S FAVORED But much of the judge's order seemed to favor the generators.  Fo=r example, state officials have made the case they should be refunded $8. 9= billion for alleged overcharges from May 2000 to May 2001 -- even though t=he regulatory commission has said only that the period starting Oct. 2, 200=0 could be considered.  The judge said yesterday that he would stick with t=he October date, meaning that more than a third of the state's claim -- at =least $3 billion -- would not be refunded by the commission.  Brent Bailey,= vice president and general counsel of Duke Energy North America, said that= under Wagner's guidelines, the state may be eligible for $1 billion to $1.=5 billion.  "Certainly to the extent that it helped refute what California =has been saying, it's a victory," Bailey said of the judge's statement.  Bu=t Davis said the nation's big power sellers never came to the table with a =serious offer.  "Not surprisingly, the energy pirates that bilked ratepayer=s out of billions of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good f=aith," Davis said.  $716 MILLION OFFER  Wagner disclosed yesterday that the= generators had made an offer to California: $716 million in refunds.  The =judge said the figure included about $510 million from the so-called Big Fi=ve generators, as well as $125 million from BC Hydro's Powerex, $49.6 milli=on by a group of 15 electricity marketers, $16.5 million by six California =municipal utilities and $25 million offered by other out-of-state power sel=lers.  California officials say it was not a legitimate offer because it in=cluded no cash. It was simply an agreement by the companies to wipe some of= the state's debt off the books.  Throughout the talks, generators complain=ed that the California team was trying to shield some California companies =and government power providers from having to pay any refunds, and trying t=o disproportionately extract sums from out-of-state power companies.  FAVOR=ITISM CHARGED According to documents and interviews, the state attempted to= remove Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison, San Diego= Gas & Electric., the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and other g=overnment power suppliers from the group from which it was asking for refun=ds, even though they were paid the same high rates for power as everyone el=se.  Representatives for the power sellers said they believe that Davis mad=e a political decision to demagogue the companies while refusing to comprom=ise on the state's claims. They say the governor calculated that his reputa=tion would be enhanced by continuing to attack the generators.  "The Califo=rnia delegation did not come into these talks with any willingness to compr=omise," said Mark Stultz, vice president of the Electric Power Supply Assoc=iation, a Washington, D.C., trade group. "They went in with a dollar figure= and never budged on that figure. If you're looking for a settlement, you h=ave to be willing to compromise."  Up next 1. The Federal Energy Regulatory= Commission will consider, probably on July 25,  new hearings on how much, =if anything, California was overcharged. 2. If ordered by the commission, a=n administrative law judge will take testimony on how much the state says i=t was overcharged and how much generators say they are owed. 3. Regulators =will rule based on the judge's recommendation. If the parties disagree, the=y can go to court.

Gray Davi=s celebrated the startup of a new power plant in Pittsburg yesterday -- the= latest in a string of openings Davis hopes will help California "build its= way" out of the energy crisis. The state rushed to throw as many megawatts= on line as it could when it looked like the summer would feature regular b=lackouts, and yesterday the governor said it was paying off.  "This is the =third plant I've helped open in the last 13 days," Davis said, pumping his =fist as the Calpine Corp. plant belched an impressive burst of steam. "In t=he past 13 days, we've put more power on the grid than California did throu=ghout the 1990s."  The 555-megawatt Los Medanos Energy Center and the Sutte=r Energy Center that Calpine opened in Yuba City last week bring a total of= 1,115 megawatts online. Last month, Davis threw the switch on a Bakersfiel=d plant that opened more than a month ahead of schedule.  Davis used yester=day's event to blast out-of-state generators that he maintains have gouged =the state for electricity. Yet he lauded San Jose-based Calpine as a sort o=f energy favorite son.  "They were the first to enter long-term contracts w=ith us," the governor said. Calpine is among the big energy firms being pre=ssed by the state to issue refunds for what the governor insists were overc=harges, but unlike the others, Davis said, Calpine is giving ground in nego=tiations.  "They likely will be the first to enter into settlements with us=," he said.  Although the Los Medanos plant is one of a generation of effic=ient new gas- fired plants that will be as much as 40 percent cheaper to ru=n than their forebears, the state will be paying well above current market =rates for the first three months of its contract with Calpine.  Calpine Pre=sident Peter Cartwright insisted, however, that the company is not making e=xcess profits off the deal. To ensure that Calpine could provide the electr=icity even if plant construction wasn't finished by its mid-July target dat=e, the company bought the needed power from other energy traders at $232 a =megawatt hour when market rates were higher, he said.  In addition to the 3=00 megawatts it has pledged to the state, Calpine will supply electricity t=o the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and other power agencies.  In t=he long term, Calpine will be selling power to California at $59 a megawatt= hour, Cartwright said.  A spokesman for the state Department of Water Reso=urces, which started buying power in January after state utilities buckled =under high prices, said Calpine's rate is well below the $70 a megawatt hou=r the state is aiming for as an average price for the long-term contracts. = Cartwright said that with its recently opened plants, along with an 875- m=egawatt facility it plans to open in Pittsburg next May, the company is doi=ng its share to ease the state's supply crunch.  "Ours are the lowest contr=acts in the state," he said. "If these plants weren't online, we'd be havin=g blackouts."  A spokeswoman from the state agency that manages the power g=rid said California is skating so close to blackouts that "every megawatt c=ounts."  "It's definitely making a difference and it will continue to do so= over the summer," said Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman for the Independent S=ystem Operator.

Hydro's power trading sub=sidiary to refund $125 million to settle the state's allegations that it wa=s overcharged by the Canadian power company.  The dispute will now be resol=ved by U.S. judicial and regulatory authorities.  The offer from Hydro's Po=werex subsidiary came during 15 days of settlement talks between power gene=rators and distributors, California and other western states.  The talks, i=nitiated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates cross=-border power sales in the United States, concluded Monday evening without =resolution.  Hydro spokeswoman Elisha Odowichuk said that under the offer, =the Crown corporation would have been subtracted $125 million from the $290= million California still owes British Columbia for power sales.  The $125 =million was Powerex's first offer and it did not change through the negotia=tions, she said. The company put conditions on that refund figure, but Odow=ichuk would not say what those conditions were.  California has charged tha=t Powerex gouged it by more than $430 million. Odowichuk said Hydro had to =join the settlement talks to preserve its otherwise lucrative power trading= relationship with California.  Electricity imports and exports statistics =compiled by Canada's National Energy Board show Powerex exported more than =$900 million worth of energy from January to April.  The average cost of th=at power was $661.56 a megawatt hour.

Gray Davis for gouging California during the power cris=is, but financial information released yesterday shows the lion's share of =the money went elsewhere.  Companies with headquarters in Texas garnered le=ss than 10 percent of California's multibillion-dollar energy purchases, wh=ile public and private energy companies from Canada to Georgia to Californi=a got the rest.  The $424 million that went to Texas companies may still be= more than the state should have been charged, and administration officials= are attempting to get refunds from a host of companies, both in and out of= Texas.  Earlier this year, Davis lambasted the Bush administration for not= acting against power firms in his home state. "What's going on here, pure =and simple, is unconscionable price-gouging by the big energy producers -- =most of them, incidentally, located in Texas," he said in May.  Yesterday, =a spokesman for the governor broadened the verbal assault, saying the Texas= firms are representative of the many other out-of-state generators who hav=e also gouged California.  "Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably h=ave handkerchiefs across their face because they are robbing us blind," sai=d Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman.  The latest financial information is co=ntained in a report by the state Department of Water Resources detailing $7=.2 billion in power purchases from Jan. 17 through the end of May.  About $=5.2 billion of that was spent on the spot market where power buys are made =a day, hour or even a few minutes before the electricity is actually used. = Because the spot purchases are made with little notice, they are the most =expensive kind of power on the market. The state was forced to step in and =buy the power when the credit ratings of California's major utilities dropp=ed as the energy crisis worsened. The crisis was caused by a series of even=ts that forced the utilities to pay more for electricity than they could re=cover from customers.  The numbers released yesterday show that Texas compa=nies weren't alone in receiving a share of the energy crisis pie. Some $1.2= billion went to Mirant, an Atlanta-based company. Mirant has refused to tu=rn over documents subpoenaed by the state Legislature as part of its invest=igation into alleged market manipulation. Mirant could face contempt procee=dings.  Municipal generators have also fared well during the energy crisis.= Powerex,  a wholly owned power marketing subsidiary of Vancouver-based BC =Hydro, received $1 billion from the state for spot market electricity.  The= Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which Davis said charged higher= average spot market prices than some generators, received $331 million.

PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it n=eeds from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy prote=ction April 6. Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the com=panies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the stat=e in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million resi=dential and business customers.

"I think we have demonstrated very clearly =both to the FERC and to the judge that the state is owed $8.9 billion and w=ill settle for nothing less," said Roger Salazar, a spokesman for Gov. Gray= Davis.  With negotiations at an impasse, the administrative law judge for =the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said California is probably owed n=o more than $1 billion in refunds.  "The numbers were too far apart," said =Curtis Wagner, the FERC chief administrative law judge.  California, Wagner= said, may receive nothing at all, because generators may be owed more than= they have to return for any overcharges.  He placed the refunds owed the s=tate at between $716 million and $1 billion. Power providers had offered $7=16 million as part of an overall settlement, while California state officia=ls sought $8.9 billion, Wagner said.  He said California officials had not =made the case for $8.9 billion in refunds.  Salazar, however, said the stat=e would go to court and may ask for $20 billion.  Separately, Wagner split =off claims of overcharges from the Pacific Northwest, saying he has not had= time to consider those allegations under the short timetable ordered by FE=RC last month.  Wagner served as a mediator during the 15 days of negotiati=ons and will recommend a settlement to FERC by next Monday. The commission =ordered the talks last month in an effort to resolve differences between pr=oducers and the state over the breakdown of California's deregulated electr=icity market.  Consumer advocates assailed the judge's recommendation and u=rged the state to continue its attempt to get refunds from what they say ar=e profiteering power companies.  "It's like catching a bank robber, but ins=tead of making him give back all of it, you only make him give back 5 perce=nt of what he stole," said Douglas Heller, spokesman for the Santa Monica-b=ased Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.  Power generators, howeve=r, were generally pleased with Wagner's comments.  Brent Bailey, general co=unsel for Duke Energy, said even if the formula Wagner recommends produces =$1.5 billion in refunds, "that's a reasonable amount in the context of thes=e settlement talks."  California officials, negotiating on behalf of utilit=ies, the Public Utilities Commission and state power buyers, accused the pr=oducers of manipulating supply to unfairly drive up prices.  The producers =have acknowledged prices are high, but blame jumps in the price of natural =gas, which fuels many power plants, and the workings of the free market.  T=he bill for wholesale power in California soared to $27 billion last year f=rom $7 billion the year before. Davis has estimated the state could spend a=s much as $50 billion this year.  The producers reiterated Monday that Cali=fornia's numbers are grossly inflated. Attorneys for the five major generat=ors -- Duke Energy, Dynegy, Mirant, Reliant Energy and the Williams Cos. --= said in a statement that they have made a "very substantial global settlem=ent offer."  Reliant would agree to no more than $50 million in refunds as =part of an overall settlement that also would have to include protection fr=om additional legal claims, said John H. Stout, a company senior vice presi=dent.  But Stout also said, "Reliant's fundamental position has been and re=mains that no refunds are justified."       Toxic fumes not linked to black=outs  Backup power OK in facilities, report says  Jason B. Johnson, Chronic=le Staff Writer  Tuesday, July 10, 2001  ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle   UR=L: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/chronicle/archive/2001=/07/10/MNC115768.DTL   Despite a power-related mishap that released toxic f=umes from an industrial plant in May, rolling blackouts are not expected to= cause dangerous releases in Contra Costa, a county study concludes.  The c=ounty Health Department report found that 52 industrial facilities have ade=quate backup power plans.  The report to be presented to the Board of Super=visors today was prompted by a freak traffic accident that knocked out powe=r at Richmond's General Chemical Corp. plant. When the plant powered back u=p, a cloud of sulfur trioxide and sulfur dioxide was released.  Contra Cost=a hazardous materials director Lew Pascalli said that there is always a pos=sibility that a plant's hydraulic or mechanical systems could fail but that= those chances are slight given the growing number of power plants coming o=nline and the state's successful conservation effort.  He also said industr=y has done a good job preparing for outages.  "The industry is doing a good=-faith effort in this particular instance to make sure that nothing happens=," Pascalli said.  County officials relied on industry records in determini=ng the adequacy of the different plans, such as having multiple electrical =leads feeding a source regulating hazardous materials.  Denny Larson, spoke=sman for the group Communities for a Better Environment, said the report re=lied too heavily on industry self-reporting.  "Unfortunately, the conclusio=ns of the report can't be backed up by the facts," Larson said. "Oil and ch=emical plants in Contra Costa have repeatedly had toxic releases due to pow=er failures over the years."  The 52 facilities include chemical plants, oi=l refineries and small shops that produce limited amounts of hazardous mate=rials.  For many of these businesses, the loss of power would shut down the=ir operations and make it impossible for substances to be released.  Larger= facilities, like oil refineries, have either their own backup generators o=r contracts with cogeneration plants that could supply all or most of their= power independent of the electricity power grid, according to the report. = Plans are also in place to conduct partial shutdowns at plants running on =reserve power during a blackout.  General Chemical said all electrical feed=s to the chamber processing chemicals are automatically pulled in the event= of loss of power. A backup generator will automatically come online to kee=p operations stable.  Dow Chemical has a contract with a Calpine power plan=t to supply it with electricity. Battery backup and diesel emergency engine=s are also at the site to ensure enough power to run lights, alarms, contro=ls and emergency shutdown equipment.  e-mail Jason B.

The judge o=verseeing the talks for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission put the re=funds at between several hundred million dollars and a billion dollars. His= estimate is closer to the $716.1 million offer made by power suppliers dur=ing negotiations. The offer was rejected by California officials.  But it w=as unclear Monday which side in the bitter refund battle would prevail, and= California officials indicated the dispute is probably headed to court. At= stake is how much the state's electricity consumers will ultimately have t=o pay for costs that skyrocketed as California's deregulation system collap=sed.  Curtis Wagner, the commission's chief administrative law judge, will =recommend a formula for the commission to use to calculate a refund dating =back to October. That formula -- a complex methodology that involves factor=s such as daily natural gas prices -- includes many of the provisions the e=nergy suppliers had advocated during the talks.  Michael Kahn, who headed t=he California negotiating team, said the state would contest some aspects o=f the formula. But even without changes, Kahn said he was confident the for=mula will result in more refunds than Wagner estimated.  ``We think the num=bers even using the judge's formula are going to be in the multiple billion=s,'' said Kahn, chairman of the state Independent System Operator, which ru=ns the electricity grid. ``California will get its $8.9 billion dollars. If= we don't get all of it from the commission . . . we'll still get the remai=nder of the money'' through the courts.  Amount in dispute  Power industry =representatives appeared pleased with the judge's plan.  ``We haven't gone =and run the full numbers but it's going to be nowhere near the $8.9 billion=,''' said Brent Bailey, vice president and general counsel for Duke Energy =North America. ``But let's face it, that's a pie-in-the-sky number that nob=ody in there believed in their right mind was a legitimate number.''  Wagne=r acknowledged he had not calculated any figures using his formula, saying =he arrived at his dollar estimate based on the offers made by the suppliers=.  The energy commission ordered the private settlement conference last mon=th when it enacted new price controls to try to rein in soaring electricity= prices in California and throughout the West. Commissioners hoped that und=er pressure of a deadline and their looming intervention the state and the =power suppliers could resolve the refund issue and stave off future litigat=ion.  But the suppliers and state officials never came close to a deal, par=ticipants said.  ``The numbers were too far apart. You saw $8.9 billion on =one end and you saw $716 million on the other end, and that's a long way to= splitting the difference,'' Wagner said. ``I think a lot of the parties ge=nuinely wanted to settle. Others didn't.''  Wagner now has until Monday to =make his recommendation to the five-member commission, which will make the =final ruling on refunds. To date, the commission has ordered $125 million i=n refunds for periods since last Oct. 2.  Wagner said Monday that he will a=sk that a special hearing be set up in the next 60 days to get the detailed= information from the state and power suppliers needed to determine a refun=d total using his formula.  The state may not end up with any cash, as any =refund total could be applied to the several billion dollars California and= its utilities still owe many of the power suppliers.  Reflecting the tone =of the negotiations, California Gov. Gray Davis on Monday blamed power supp=liers for the failure of the talks and challenged the commission to resolve= the situation.  ``Not surprisingly, the energy pirates that bilked ratepay=ers out of billions of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good= faith with our team in Washington, D.C.,'' Davis said. ``While in the past= the FERC has shown little, if any, interest in consumers, they now have th=e opportunity to redeem themselves by returning the $8.9 billion California= has demonstrated it is owed.''  Davis may go to court  At the opening of a= new power plant in Contra Costa County on Monday, Davis told reporters tha=t he's prepared to take the power generators to court if FERC doesn't order= the full refund. Davis also said the ISO's estimate of $8.9 billion doesn'=t represent all the overcharges. He said other estimates put the figure as =high as $20 billion, although he did not elaborate about how those figures =were calculated.  John H. Stout, senior vice president for Reliant Energy W=holesale Group, said the state used faulty methodology to arrive at the $8.=9 billion figure.  California officials and several suppliers said they wou=ld continue to negotiate separately, and an official with San Jose-based Ca=lpine said his company is close to a settlement with the state.  Power supp=liers urged Wagner not to calculate refunds by applying the energy commissi=ons' June price-limits plan retroactively. But that's what Wagner said he w=ill do. It was a victory for California officials, who had pushed for it. W=agner, however, also made some changes to the price-limit plan that power s=uppliers had wanted. He applied it only back to Oct. 2, 2000. State officia=ls wanted it to cover up to May 2000.  $3 billion difference  The state's $=8.9 billion figure comes from May 2000 through May 2001. Factoring refunds =beginning with Oct. 2, 2000, eliminates about $3 billion in overcharges the= state says occurred in the earlier period.  Among the changes to the commi=ssion's formula that Wagner made was to revise the way the prevailing elect=ricity price limit is calculated. Wagner wants the price limit determined f=or each hour of each day. The commission's formula sets a price limit durin=g Stage One power emergencies that remains in effect until the next emergen=cy.  But in a sign of just how complex the issue is, Stanford University ec=onomist Frank Wolak said he believes the standards described by the judge w=ill produce a much higher figure than $1 billion.  ``That's the methodology= the state used,'' said Wolak, who advises the California ISO on market iss=ues. ``By using the marginal unit for each hour, you'll get refund numbers =on the order of what the state estimated.''

The state spent an additional $2.5 billion on a variety of contracts a=nd other electricity services designed to stabilize the volatile energy mar=kets, according to documents that the state agreed to release last week ami=d a legal dispute over public access to the data.  In roughly the first fiv=e months of the year, the state shelled out $1.2 billion to Atlanta-based M=irant, the most any company was paid for electricity, followed by $1 billio=n to Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hydro in British Columbia. It also pa=id $331 million to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.  The docu=ments raise questions about some of the common assumptions that have arisen= around the electricity crisis. For instance, almost 40 percent of the stat=e's purchases have come from government-run power generators in California =and elsewhere, but not Texas; some of the biggest suppliers are from the No=rthwest.  Gov. Gray Davis, who has ambitions to run for the White House, ha=s put much of the blame for the soaring costs of power on energy companies =based in President Bush's home state.  The figures are tucked inside 1,770 =of pages of invoices that Davis has resisted divulging, saying disclosure w=ould encourage suppliers to charge more. The state, which last month releas=ed information on its long-term electricity contracts worth $43 billion, ag=reed Thursday to release the first quarter details.  Short on explanation  =The figures were disclosed late Monday by the California Department of Wate=r Resources, which buys power for the state's financially strapped major ut=ilities, and seem to buttress the administration's contention that the pric=e of power is gradually dropping but offer little or no explanation for wha=t prompted the decrease.  In January, for instance, the average price for p=ower on the spot market was $321 a megawatt hour. It peaked in April at $33=2 and dropped to $271 in May.  One megawatt powers about 750 homes.  Davis =spokesman Steve Maviglio said the price data supports the governor's assert=ions that California has been gouged. ``The bad guys are clearly the out-of=-state generators,'' Maviglio said. ``There has been a significant shift of= money out of California.''  But the documents fail to shed much light on w=hether, as the administration contends, the price drop was due to long-term= power contracts negotiated by the state earlier this year. Critics contend= that the Davis administration panicked and rushed into deals that commit t=he state to pay high prices for many years.  Used for support  Republican o=fficials used the price information to bolster their attacks against Davis,= a Democrat, for signing long-term contracts with power generators even as =the price of power on the spot market was coming down, partly because of th=e declining price of natural gas used to fuel many plants.  ``It's more cle=ar than ever that the long-term contracts are a bad deal,'' said Assemblyma=n Tony Strickland, R-Camarillo. ``The governor's really hurt the ratepayers= for the next five or 10 years.''  The newly released bills highlight the v=olatility of California's energy market, where the price per megawatt hour =ranged from $70 to $1,000. On any given day, the records show, the prices f=rom seller to seller varied widely, with some of the highest prices being c=harged by public utilities and companies outside Texas.  On one day in Febr=uary, for example, San Diego-based Sempra Energy was charging $165 per mega=watt hour, the Eugene Water and Electric Board was charging nearly $500 and= Duke Energy, a North Carolina company, was charging up to $575.  The state='s daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million for all power, including =the spot market and contracted power.  The state began buying power in mid-=January on behalf of the state's major utilities, which were unable to borr=ow money to buy power after amassing enormous debts for electricity.  San J=ose-based Calpine Corp., which is building several new power plants around =California including one in South San Jose, did only $29 million worth of b=usiness with the state in the first five months of the year, according to t=he figures.  The state began buying power in mid-January when Pacific Gas &= Electric Co. and Southern California Edison Co. were on the ropes financia=lly. PG&E later went into bankruptcy.  On Monday, state lawmakers took anot=her shot at trying to cobble together a plan to rescue financially ailing E=dison.  While most concede that a rescue plan Davis worked out with Edison =will not win the necessary support in the Legislature, lawmakers have creat=ed several working groups to come up with alternatives.  Compromise plan  O=n Monday, state Sen. Byron Sher, D-Redwood City, unveiled the latest compro=mise proposal that seeks to protect average ratepayers and small businesses= from further rate increases and forces everyone else to help finance the E=dison bailout.  The ``shared pain'' proposal would force power producers, o=wed about $1 billion, to take a 30 percent ``haircut'' and agree to forgive= about $300 million in Edison debts. Edison would be asked to swallow $1.2 =billion -- about a third of its debt. And big users would be asked to pay o=ff the remaining $2 billion in debts, possibly by paying higher prices for =power.  In exchange, large companies would be given the opportunity to buy =power on the open market, a system that would allow many of them to sign ch=eap energy deals.  Sher presented the proposal to Senate Democrats Monday a=fternoon, but it remains unclear how much support the framework will receiv=e in the Legislature.

July 10, 2001  By DENA BUNIS and JOHN HOWARD The Orange County Registe=r  WASHINGTON The nation's chief energy judge said Monday that California i=s owed maybe $1 billion in refunds from power generators, a fraction of the= $8.9 billion demanded by Gov. Gray Davis.  And even at that, said Judge Cu=rtis Wagner, the electricity sellers are owed so much more in unpaid power =bills that in the end California might not see one red cent.  Wagner announ=ced his recommendation to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission after tw=o weeks of fruitless negotiations between all the parties to California's e=lectricity crisis. With no settlement, the matter is now in the commissione=rs' hands.  Power generators, Wagner said, had offered a combined $716 mill=ion in refunds, an offer the state rejected. "I don't think it's 8.9 (billi=on dollars)," he said afterwards, "because I haven't been shown that it was=."  For California consumers, every dollar the state can extract in refunds= is a dollar less that ratepayers have to shell out for state-purchased pow=er. And the more money the state gets back, the better the chances of wardi=ng off future rate increases.  "California will get its $8.9 billion," insi=sted Michael Kahn, head of the state's delegation and the California Indepe=ndent System Operator. Kahn brushed off Wagner's comments, finding victory =in the judge's assertion that the state is owed some refunds, a concept the= generators have been unwilling to embrace up to now, he said.  Since the t=alks began, some generators have made refund offers -- last week Duke Energ=y offered $20 million and on Monday, Reliant officials revealed their refun=d offer was $50 million, provided all other actions against the company wer=e dropped.  But the net result of the 15- day closed-door sessions is that =California is no closer to getting repaid for what it claims was price goug=ing by power companies going back to May 2000 than it was the day the talks= began.  And it means the state is in for possibly more hearings before the= FERC. If unsuccessful there, the whole issue could wind up in court for ye=ars.  "You can take a horse to water but cannot make him drink," Wagner sai=d during an afternoon public session where he made his preliminary recommen=dation. He has seven days to put his ideas in writing. At several points du=ring the often-tense talks, Wagner expressed frustration to the negotiators= and tried to get them to agree, even to the point of holding an unpreceden=ted Sunday session.  "The numbers were too far apart," Wagner said.  While =Kahn insisted the state had made progress, on hearing of the judge's commen=ts, state Sen. John Burton, D-Francisco, called them "barely better than a =jab in the eye with a sharp stick." Burton agreed with Kahn that the state =has to do all it can to get more than that.  And Davis backed up his team. = "Our delegation made a clear and compelling factual argument that there we=re overcharges made because the market was broken," Davis said. "Remarkably=, the energy generators and suppliers refused to recognize their responsibi=lity to the people of California and own up to their profiteering."  Power =generators seemed satisfied with the judge's views, even though John Stout,= vice president of Reliant Energy, said his company's "fundamental position= has been and remains that no refunds are justified."  Brent Bailey, genera=l counsel for Duke Energy, called the judge's recommendation, "a fair one."=  Republican lawmakers in Sacramento were quick to say it was Davis' failed= energy policies that brought California to this point. They also distanced= themselves from the state's refund request.  "I don't believe there really= exists a true justification for that number," said Assemblyman John Campbe=ll, R-Irvine. "I've never considered that anything more than a wild number =to throw out there."  The two sides are so far apart in their estimates of =overcharges because they are using different assumptions about how to compu=te the complex pricing structure. And Wagner was more persuaded with the ma=jority of the generators' methods.  To start with, the state is asking for =$8.9 billion, but about $3 billion of those alleged overcharges happened be=tween May and October 2000, a period FERC is not looking at. FERC issued tw=o refund orders in March, finding that power companies had $124 million in =overcharges during power alerts. But the state is challenging that finding,= saying there were overcharges beyond those limited times. And the state is= also asking FERC to reconsider allowing refunds for May to October 2000.  =How energy panel affects California  Six months ago, few people had heard o=f FERC. Now the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency charged wi=th making sure that the nation's power markets are running smoothly and tha=t wholesale prices are "just and reasonable," rolls off the tongue.  The fi=ve commissioners who make up FERC - all of whom were members of their home =state's Public Utilities Commissions - ordered the settlement talks that co=ncluded Monday. They had hoped all the parties involved in California's ele=ctricity crisis could reach an agreement on proposed refunds, long-term pow=er contracts and other issues that have divided the parties for months. FER=C's chief judge, Curtis Wagner, was asked to mediate the talks.  WHAT WAS A=T STAKE?  For the state: $8.9 billion that Gov. Gray Davis said was the amo=unt power companies overcharged California in the past year. Wagner's findi=ng? There should be refunds. But more like $1 billion.  For the generators:= More than $5 billion that they say they are owed for unpaid power bills. W=agner's finding? Generators are owed more money than the refunds they owe C=alifornia. He did not specify by how much.  For California consumers: A sta=ble electricity market. Until the refund issue is settled and power prices =are stabilized long term, what the future holds for rate increase remains u=ncertain. Wagner's finding? No settlement. Consumers still in limbo.  HOW D=ID WE GET HERE?  In spring 2000, wholesale power prices began to soar. The =state began appealing to FERC to cap wholesale prices. In the meantime the =utilities were running out of money. Generators weren't paid for all the el=ectricity they sold. Rolling blackouts began.  Starting in January, the sta=te began buying the power, replacing the near-bankrupt utilities. Politicia=ns from Sacramento to Washington increased the pressure on FERC to cap rate=s. More than $27 billion was spent to buy power for California last year, c=ompared with $7 billion the year before. The price tag could reach $50 bill=ion this year.  On June 19, FERC imposed the kind of soft price caps expert=s say could moderate wholesale rates. Wholesale prices have come down, but =the caps have caused confusion among generators, leading some to hold some =power off the market.  WHAT'S NEXT?  The FERC commissioners will receive Wa=gner's report within a week. In it, he will suggest they hold a fast-track =formal hearing that would last no more than 60 days.  If they agree, after =that hearing the commission would rule on refunds and other California mark=et issues.  If either the state or the other parties to this dispute disagr=ee, they can contest FERC's decision in court. Such legal proceedings could= last many years.                State reveals details of power purchases  =Report shows last-minute energy buys in first three months of 2001.  July 1=0, 2001  By JENNIFER COLEMAN The Associated Press  SACRAMENTO On three days= in May, California's daily power allowance topped $100 million, according =to a report released by state power traders.  The California Department of =Water Resources released the report Monday, along with 1,770 pages of docum=ents that also detailed the last- minute power purchases the state made on =the spot market in the first three months of the year.  The report details =the department's electricity spending since Jan. 17, when the state took ov=er electricity purchases for Pacific Gas & Electric Co., San Diego Gas & El=ectric Co., and Southern California Edison.  The utilities had amassed bill=ions in debts and were no longer creditworthy enough to purchase power. Sin=ce then, the state has spent nearly $8 billion to keep the lights on.  The =state's daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million. The second-highest =daily total was May 23, when the state spent $101.8 million.  But since May=, spot-market prices have dropped, due in part to moderate weather, lower n=atural gas prices, increased conservation that lowered demand and because o=f increased scrutiny by lawmakers and investigators into possible price man=ipulation. Gov. Gray Davis has said long-term contracts also drove the pric=e down.  "It does look like some of the spot-market prices have gone down, =but it looks like it's primarily due to natural gas prices," said Jamie Fis=fis, spokesman for Assembly Republicans.  The slight reduction in spot-mark=et prices "underscores questions about the strategy of locking us into long=-term contracts, if natural gas prices continue to drop," Fisfis said.  Mos=t of the long-term contracts run for 10 years, with one lasting for 20 year=s.  Davis already has released details of the state's long-term power contr=acts after losing a court battle with Republican legislators and several ne=ws organizations.  But Davis wanted to delay the release of the spot-market= buys and short-term contracts until now to keep the state's buying strateg=y secret.According to the state, Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. got $1.24 billi=on as of May 31 for spot-market purchases.  Canadian Powerex, the marketing= arm of BC Hydro, has been paid $1.05 billion.  The newly released short-te=rm contracts also show that on March 19-20, when the state had rolling blac=kouts, the state paid above-average prices in its largest short-term contra=cts.  For example, Mirant sold the state 650 megawatt-hours at off-peak usa=ge times on March 20 for $345 a megawatt-hour, more than $70 above the aver=age price of $272.96.                 Tuesday, July 10, 2001        Ghost o=f Bob Citron roaming halls of capitol  Gray Davis is following footsteps of= former O.C. treasurer into fiscal chaos     JOHN M.W. MOORLACH  Mr. Moorla=ch is the Orange County treasurer-tax collector.   A recent L.A. Times poll= found that Californians still remain unconvinced that our state suffers fr=om a shortage of energy. Perhaps the state's subsidizing of the actual cost=s for electricity these past five months has caused us to believe that ever=ything is fine. It is not.  The state has been spending an average of $57 m=illion, a medium-sized city's annual budget, per day for electricity. Now C=alifornia is headed toward the same financial catastrophe that was imposed =on its shareholder-owned utilities, finding one of them in Chapter 11 bankr=uptcy and another on the precipice. At this pace, it will not be long befor=e the state will be staring a Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing in the face.  Tha=t's why I'm gnawed by this "d?j? vu" sensation. The similarities and parall=els between California of 2001 and Orange County of 1994 are frightening. H=ere's a refresher. In 1994 the county, through former Treasurer Robert Citr=on, was borrowing at variable rates and investing at fixed rates. The "expe=rts" and the "politicos" were comfortable with the investment scheme.  No w=onder the electorate was convinced that there were no investing improprieti=es. Even while their former treasurer was very secretive about how he was i=nvesting and what his "exit strategy" would be. Guess what? The unexpected =happened. Short-term borrowing rates doubled. The cost of borrowing suddenl=y exceeded the revenues being generated.  It caused the investment pool to =implode and Orange County taxpayers realized a $1.64 billion loss. In spite= of pleas to avoid or minimize this train wreck the county's leadership, he= ignored it. The rest is history. In a half-pregnant deregulation scheme, t=he state capped the retail price that the utilities can charge. It also eli=minated the availability to acquire electricity through the use of long-ter=m contracts.  Guess what? The unexpected happened. The wholesale price for =electricity spiked dramatically above the inflexible retail price cap. It d=epleted the available funds for the utilities, and then some, and they are =imploding. In spite of pleas from the utilities imploring Gov. Gray Davis t=o avoid or minimize this train wreck, he ignored them. The rest is also his=tory.  It gets worse. Davis doesn't allow for the immediate raising of reta=il rates and decides to have the state secretly purchase electricity. Guess= what? The expected happened. He depleted our budget surplus! Our reserves!= Nearly $9 billion - and counting! He's a Citron, only quintupled!  And in =the light of day, the secret purchases were not attractively priced and onl=y compound this financial nightmare. Gov. Davis has done what no Libertaria=n or Republican could ever dream of doing in such a short time. He has retu=rned the budget surplus created by taxpayers to the residents of California= by subsidizing their electricity bills.  Bravo! It may not be the most equ=itable way of refunding taxes, but has anyone ever thought up a more effici=ent method? But, that's not all. He wants it back! Davis now wants to borro=w some $13 billion to replace the spent reserves and purchase even more ele=ctricity at rates in excess of the retail prices! When does this train wrec=k in slow motion stop?  And how do we pay off these bonds? Davis did not wa=nt to raise rates last summer or this past winter. But now he will to pay o=ff this historically largest municipal bond offering with a significant uti=lity rate increase. The ratepayers will be reminded for 10 years after Davi=s is gone about his expensive brilliance. And this elected official wants t=o purchase the power grids and bureaucratically manage the utilities? I say= "no."  If we don't show some leadership in Sacramento soon, potential bond= buyers will also say "no," unless they receive an attractive interest rate=. Just ask Edison International about attractive interest rates. It just su=bscribed $800 million in bonds paying 14 percent. Tragically, Gov. Davis wa=lked into his position with an existing budget surplus and now has no tangi=ble legacy to show for it. No reserves. No improved highways. No new school=s. No infrastructure improvements. Only interest payments.  Wasn't that Cit=ron's legacy? If amortized over 10 years at 6 percent, the citizens of Cali=fornia will pay an additional $4.4 billion in interest costs. Over 15 years= it's $6.7 billion. And therein lies the true legacy of Davis, squandering =the entire budget surplus that he inherited on interest resulting from his =indecisiveness and lack of leadership!  It is so tragic that the perpetrato=r of this colossal mess is still in denial and continues to play the "blame= game." Orange County played the "blame game," too. But it had obvious perp=etrators and succeeded in a court of law in securing a significant amount i=n retribution payments. I'm not so sure California will have a similar resu=lt.            Calpine's Los Medanos Energy Center Adds Needed Generation t=o California Second New Major Base Load Generator for California        Jul=y 10, 2001      Second New Major Base Load Generator for California  SAN JO=SE, Calif., July 9 /PRNewswire/ -- San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine Corporati=on (NYSE: CPN) announced today that its 555-megawatt Los Medanos Energy Cen=ter in Pittsburg, Calif. is providing needed electricity to California's st=rained power grid. Los Medanos is the second major combined-cycle facility =to be licensed and built in California in over a decade. Fueled by natural =gas, the facility is designed to add up to 555-megawatts of clean, reliable= electricity to California on a 24 hours a day, seven days a week availabil=ity. As a cogeneration facility, the project also delivers electricity and =steam to USS POSCO for use in industrial processing.  Governor Gray Davis a=nd Calpine CEO Peter Cartwright will hold a press conference Monday afterno=on to commission the Los Medanos Energy Center and to recognize the support= of the local community, the construction and trades people, and numerous o=rganizations that helped develop the facility.  Cartwright said, "We are co=mmitted to creating innovative energy solutions for California's growing po=wer market. Los Medanos exemplifies excellence in power generation-ratepaye=rs and the environment benefit as Calpine brings to California new energy r=esources like Los Medanos."  Los Medanos is the second of eleven announced =modern, fuel-efficient energy centers Calpine is building in the State as p=art of a $6 billion energy initiative. Three additional facilities are unde=r construction, including an 880-megawatt facility in Pittsburg at Dow Chem=ical's facility. By year-end 2005, Calpine expects to be generating 12,000 =megawatts of clean, affordable electricity to help repower California.  Cal=pine broke ground on the Los Medanos Energy Center in September 1999. More =than 600 construction and trade personnel worked on the project over a 20-m=onth period. During the past several months, the project scheduled two ten-=hour shifts, seven days a week to get the plant operating as soon as possib=le in light of the energy crisis. And over the past several weeks, technica=l teams worked round the clock to complete the facility. The total cost of =construction is estimated to be approximately $350 million.  The Los Medano=s Energy Center is located in Pittsburg, Calif., in Contra Costa County adj=acent to the USS POSCO plant and is operated by a 22-member staff of highly= trained personnel.  As with all of Calpine's modern base load facilities, =Los Medanos uses combined-cycle design with natural gas-fired turbines in c=ombination with a steam turbine to achieve maximum fuel efficiency. Advance=d emissions control technology enables Calpine to reduce certain emissions =by more than 90 percent.  Based in San Jose, Calif., Calpine Corporation is= dedicated to providing customers with reliable and competitively priced el=ectricity. Calpine is focused on clean, efficient, natural gas-fired genera=tion and is the world's largest producer of renewable geothermal energy. Ca=lpine has launched the largest power development program in North America. =To date, the company has approximately 34,000 megawatts of base load capaci=ty and 7,200 megawatts of peaking capacity in operation, under construction=, pending acquisitions and in announced development in 29 states, the Unite=d Kingdom and Canada.

The failure of the negotiations shifts the burden of resolving= the yearlong dispute to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, to which= the mediator may recommend a pricing formula that would mean refunds of ab=out $1 billion. California , which wants $8.9 billion, vowed today that it =would seek that much and more, through the courts if necessary.  Although e=lectricity prices in the West have eased in recent weeks, the power crisis =that has afflicted California and other Western states seems unlikely to be= resolved unless rival parties can agree on how much electricity should hav=e cost during the last 13 months.  The power market has been mired in an ac=counting gridlock. The state claims that generating companies began grossly= overcharging for electricity -- with prices soaring by a factor of 10 or 2=0 over year-before levels -- beginning in late spring last year. Generators= say they are prepared to pay some refunds, but argue that California 's es=timates of overcharges are radically inflated.  The mediator in the settlem=ent talks was Curtis L. Wagner Jr., an administrative law judge for the fed=eral agency, who said today that the negotiations had failed to reach the c=omprehensive voluntary settlement he had sought.  Mr. Wagner said he would =recommend to the agency's commissioners that they convene a 60-day evidenti=ary hearing that would impose an administrative solution. He also said he w=ould suggest a method for determining fair prices for electricity .  Under =federal law, the energy commission has the obligation to ensure ''just and =reasonable'' electricity rates. Though the commission declared last year th=at California 's electricity market had broken down, it only recently began= imposing price controls on the market and has yet to address accusations o=f past overcharges systematically.  While the scope of any refunds remains =uncertain, Mr. Wagner's remarks appeared more favorable for generators than= for Western states, which have collectively pressed for as much as $15 bil=lion in refunds.  Mr. Wagner said that to determine how much California sho=uld have paid for power since last September, when the commission began mon=itoring California energy prices, he would suggest that the agency retroact=ively apply a price control formula it adopted in June. He also indicated t=hat he supported a way of calculating the costs of power generation that is= closer to the method favored by power companies than to the one put forwar=d by California officials. The judge suggested that the formula he is recom=mending could require generators to pay back hundreds of millions or ''mayb=e a billion'' dollars.  California officials gave a positive cast to the ju=dge's statements, calling them a step forward because he formally acknowled=ged that companies would have to pay some refunds. They also noted that wha=tever the level of federally mandated refunds, they would have the option o=f seeking more in court.  ''We are still going to get the $8.9 billion,'' s=aid Michael Kahn, who represented Gov. Gray Davis of California in the talk=s. ''If we don't get it all from the commission, we will get the remainder =in the courts.''  Governor Davis himself said today that if the agency did =not provide refunds in the amount the state claims it is owed, it would sue= generators for $18 billion to $20 billion. ''We are in a war with generato=rs, mostly out of state, that are trying to bleed us dry,'' Mr. Davis said,= speaking at the ceremonial opening of a power plant in Northern California= .  Representatives of several generating companies said that during the se=ttlement talks, they collectively offered to refund California about $500 m=illion. They estimated that the calculation method suggested by the judge w=ould result in refunds of no more than $1.5 billion -- far closer to their =offer than to California 's demand.  Still, several executives said they no=w hoped to reach individual settlements with the state that would end the t=hreat of prolonged litigation and allow them to collect several billion dol=lars they say they are owed by the state and its leading, financially press=ed utilities, which ran up huge debts to suppliers in the last year.  ''We =remain very interested in reaching a global settlement with the state that =will put this problem behind us once and for all,'' said Brent Bailey, vice= president and general counsel of Duke Energy.       Financial  Energy Refu=nd Talks Fail In Calif.; Federal Agency's Judge To Propose Settlement Peter= Behr    07/10/2001  The Washington Post  FINAL  Page E01  Copyright 2001, =The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved  California consumers were over=charged by as much as $1 billion by electricity suppliers since October, a =federal administrative judge said yesterday after state officials and power= suppliers failed to reach an agreement on the disputed charges.  Gov. Gray= Davis (D) and California power officials wanted $8.9 billion in refunds da=ting back to May 2000, when the state's energy crisis began.  A group of ge=nerating companies headed by units of Duke Energy Corp., Reliant Energy Inc=. and Williams Cos. offered refunds of $716.1 million in the past week, goi=ng back to October. The companies said refunds should be offset by the larg=er amounts they are owed for unpaid power deliveries to the state.  "The nu=mbers were too far apart," Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief judge of the Federal= Energy Regulatory Commission, told reporters after two weeks of closed neg=otiations ended yesterday. Wagner acknowledged that his refund number was i=mprecise and said further hearings before FERC are needed to pin down the f=igure.  Calpine Corp. of San Jose and possibly one other supplier are expec=ted to reach individual settlements with the state, the judge said.  "A lot= of the parties genuinely wanted to settle and others didn't," Wagner told =reporters. "There's an old southern saying," said the 72-year-old Tennessea=n. "You can take a horse to water, but you can't make it drink."  He declin=ed to say which side balked, but previously he had blasted California offic=ials for not modifying their initial demands.  Wagner said he will send his= own refund formula to FERC's five commissioners within a week. His formula= essentially will reflect what he thinks reasonable electricity prices woul=d have been in the state at various times since October, considering fuel c=osts and other factors. Charges over those levels would be subject to refun=d, if FERC agrees.  The judge's recommendation is likely to carry considera=ble weight with FERC's commissioners, according to energy analysts. Earlier= this year, FERC tentatively ordered $125 million in refunds for the first =three months of this year, an amount that Davis called far too low.  Facing= increasing political pressure from Congress, FERC -- with two new members =appointed by President Bush -- has taken a harder line on California 's pow=er prices. Last month, the commissioners imposed price restraints on wholes=ale power transactions in California and 10 other western states. Wagner pa=tterned his formula after FERC's ruling last month.  The nation's wealthies=t state has been battered by an extraordinary surge in electricity and gas =prices that have pushed its electricity costs up from $7 billion in 1999 to= an estimated $27 billion last year. Power prices did not retreat from reco=rd levels until last month.  Davis's top aides quickly claimed vindication =yesterday.  "We think the numbers, even using the judge's formula, are goin=g to be in the multiple billions," said Michael Kahn, chairman of the Calif=ornia Independent System Operator, the state's power grid manager.  Kahn no=ted that the state refused to drop a growing list of legal claims against t=he principal energy suppliers, most of them headquartered outside the state=. The companies had insisted on being released from the state's legal claim=s as part of any settlement, according to sources close to the negotiations=.  "We will have a viable claim in state court and other jurisdictions for =the remainder," Kahn said. " California will get its $8.9 billion."  But th=e state's own expert witness, economist Eric Hildebrandt, chief market moni=tor for the California grid, testified before Wagner that the out-of-state =generators and other nonpublic power suppliers would owe about $3.7 billion= using FERC's pricing formula of last month -- less than half the $8.9 bill=ion goal.  Duke Energy is "very pleased'' by Wagner's action, said Brent Ba=iley, vice president and general counsel of the Charlotte-based company. Th=e generators, however, repeated their claims that Davis is trying to make t=hem scapegoats for the state's failed electricity deregulation plan.  The m=ajor generators, in a statement yesterday, said they had delivered only 20 =million megawatt hours out of the 145 million the state power grid used fro=m October 2000 to last May. (A megawatt supplies enough power for about 750= homes.)  California utilities and municipal power companies also reaped la=rge profits, the generators said.  "The refunds sought by California would =send a profoundly counterproductive message to suppliers: when prices are l=ow and surpluses exist, you face a steep downside; when scarcity develops a=nd prices rise we will take away all upside [profit]. No one will invest [i=n California power facilities] in that climate," the generators' statement =said. "The power supply shortage thus will continue without relief."   http=://www.washingtonpost.com  Contact: http://www.washingtonpost.com          =  Economy   California and Energy Companies Miss Deadline By Richard B. Sch=mitt    07/10/2001  The Wall Street Journal  Page A2  (Copyright (c) 2001, =Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  WASHINGTON -- State officials and power-company= executives failed to meet a federal deadline for settling $8.9 billion of =disputed California electricity charges, as a federal mediator overseeing t=he talks suggested the state's demand was excessive.  Cautioning that he ha=dn't done formal calculations, Curtis L. Wagner Jr., the chief administrati=ve law judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, put the level of =potential refunds at "hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe a billion doll=ars." He also said any sums due the state could well be offset by monies it=s insolvent utilities owe in unpaid power bills.  Mr. Wagner said he would =recommend to the commission that any refunds be calculated only from Octobe=r -- the state had been seeking rebates calculated from May 2000 -- in line= with an earlier FERC jurisdictional ruling. That decision alone would shav=e $3 billion from the $8.9 billion claim.  Mr. Wagner, who is expected to i=ssue formal findings in the next few days, said he would recommend that the= FERC hold an evidentiary hearing to assess the correct method for figuring= refunds.  The collapse of the talks doesn't preclude individual deals late=r between energy companies and the state, which has accused them of overcha=rging for power during the past two years. Yesterday, some industry lawyers= indicated a willingness to keep bargaining, and Mr. Wagner said two "parti=al" settlements were in the works.  Yet, absent any such solution, the over=charge issue -- a flash point in the California power crisis -- is apt to b=e resolved in protracted legal and regulatory proceedings, which could drag= on for months or even years.  The negotiations began June 25, with a deadl=ine set for midnight last night. But late yesterday, participants indicated= they were billions of dollars apart, with basic differences over everythin=g from the disputed charges to doubts about whether the FERC, which ordered= the talks, could enforce a deal because of the industry's questions about =the reach of the agency's authority.  "We haven't reached a settlement. We =really haven't come close," said John Stout a senior vice president of Reli=ant Energy Inc.'s wholesale-power group. Reliant had offered to pay Califor=nia about $50 million to extricate itself from the fight. That is more than= a third of the Houston company's operating profit during the relevant peri=od, he said, although far shy of the more than $375 million California soug=ht from Reliant.  Mr. Wagner said the industry offered a total of $716 mill=ion to settle the matter.  The refund issue is fast becoming a test of the =agency's authority and credibility. The FERC, a onetime regulatory backwate=r, has come under intense scrutiny of late for its largely hands-off monito=ring of deregulated California markets. The commission has ordered some com=panies to pay refunds, but they have been relatively small -- such as a $12=4 million rebate covering wholesale electricity bills in California in Janu=ary and February.  California Gov. Gray Davis has said he hopes two new FER=C members will take a much more aggressive tack. The agency is expected to =act quickly on the judge's call for a hearing and other findings.  Yesterda=y, Michael Kahn, a San Francisco lawyer representing Gov. Davis at the sett=lement, declared he was "gratified" by Mr. Wagner's findings, saying they v=alidated the state's claims to some refunds, a concept the industry had rej=ected at the talks' outset. "We've had a ringing endorsement of the idea of= refunds and we'll get back lots of money," he said, adding that what the s=tate doesn't recoup via the FERC it will pursue in court.  But power genera=tors, who derided the state's request for a huge refund as "ludicrous" and ="unsound," felt vindicated by yesterday's proceedings. "The state came away= with far less than its expectations," said Robert Loeffler, an attorney fo=r a unit of AES Corp. of Arlington, Va. "The common expectation now is that= any refunds will be way below this $9 billion."=09

All told, California paid $7.7  billion in spot purchases of electricity from 69 agencies across the United  States during the first five months of 2001, according to a report delivered to  lawmakers Monday.  The data also shows that the state paid a hefty average of $263 per  megawatt-hour for the power. But what's most striking is the long list of  agencies, both private and public, that sold power to California.  Agencies like the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power, $331 million;  the California Independent System Operator, $3.9 million; Public Service Company  of New Mexico, $126 million; and PG&E Energy Trading Company, $24 million.  Receiving the most money was Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold $1.2 billion of  electricity to the state January through May. The second-largest seller was  Powerex, a subsidiary of Canada's BC Hydro, which earned $1 billion.  The total cost per day ranged from as little as $20 million to more than $100  million on three separate days in May, when hot weather and tight supplies  boosted spot market prices.  In addition, the report reveals that the state's energy consultants  significantly underestimated the amount of energy the state would need to buy in  April and May. Navigant Consulting, Inc., forecast the state would have to buy  12.1 million megawatt-hours for the two months but the state ended up purchasing  15.1 million megawatt-hours.

That sale, reported by the California Independent System Operator andconfirmed by the LADWP in an interview last June, was one of many instancesinwhich the municipal utility cashed in on California's power crisis.  On Monday, the Department of Water Resources, the agency that has beenpurchasing California's bulk power needs in lieu of the state'scash-strappedutilities, released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showingtheLADWP charged the state an average of $242 a megawatt-hour for power fromJan.18 through May 31 this year. That price is about $35 higher than thosechargedby most of the out-of-state generators Gov. Gray Davis has criticizedrepeatedlyas price gougers.  Potentially embarrassing for the Davis administration, however, is thattheLADWP was formerly run by General Manager David Freeman, who in April becameDavis' top energy adviser.  Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis, said Texas-based generators areprimarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the state'stwolargest utilities.  "Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs acrosstheirface, because they are robbing us blind," he said. "The bad guys are clearlytheout-of-state generators."  Freeman's trademark is a white Stetson.  The former LADWP chief, who last September quipped that a "blind pig couldmake money" under California's faulty deregulation setup, didn't returncallsfor comment.  Freeman took a leave of absence from the LADWP in January to negotiatelong-term power contracts on behalf of the state.     Power To Sell  According to the DWR report, the LADWP brought in $331 million sellingpowerto the state between Jan. 18 and May 31 this year.  The LADWP, which didn't take part in the state's deregulation debacle andwhich isn't under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators, also cashedinthroughout 2000. The utility has 7,000 megawatts of generation capacity butonlyneeds about 5,500 MW to serve its retail customers, freeing it to sell asmuchas 1,000 megawatts to the ISO at prices comparable to what the generatorswerecharging.  The LADWP did so well that it was able to pay down $200 million in debtandwill reduce its customers' rates in 2002.  "It just shows you that enterprise is where you find it," Freeman said inaninterview last year.  Last July, ratings agency Fitch concluded that California's electricityshortage provided LADWP "an opportunity for the sale of surplus power atfavorable prices which added to the municipal system's coffers."  According to a report by the ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid,theLADWP overcharged California for power from May 2000 through February 2001by asmuch as $20 million. Maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from theutility.  On Tuesday, an LADWP spokesman defended the utility's power prices, sayingthecosts of producing electricity were extremely high.  The ISO has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly $9 billion forelectricity sales in the 12 months ended May 2001. On Monday, settlementtalksbetween state officials and generators over the refunds broke down.  Other municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal UtilityDistrictand private companies like BC Hydro in Canada, have also racked up enormoussumsselling surplus power to California at the last minute.  -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;jason.leopold@dowjones.com  (END) Dow Jones Newswires  07-10-01  1557EDT(AP-DJ)--07-10-01 1557EDT:TICKER: EIX PCG SRE:SUBJECT: EUTL CA COBO MU PETRCopyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones and Company, Inc.Received by NewsEDGE/LAN: 7/10/01 12:57 PM
