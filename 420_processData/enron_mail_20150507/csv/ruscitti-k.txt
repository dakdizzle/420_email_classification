Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. (You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

PG&E and EdisonInternational are doomed, as they should be.  The state of CA is going to godown the tubes unless they find some good leadership.  Unfortunately, nooneout there seems to have the least clue on how to solve the problem.  The politiciansare a complete joke.  It is incredibly disheartening to witness the absolute stupidityof the CA politicians in addressing this issue.  They seem to be much more focused on finger pointing than coming up with a viable solution.  I honestly think they are incableof solving the problem.  KR

jstamas@carolina.rr.com,jstamas@carolina.rr.com,jstamas@carolina.rr.com,Subject: Good Buying Opportunity????,Stamos,I don't think many buying opportunities out there.   The economy is going to get crushed this year.  There's only one place to put one's money now, and that is in cash.The manufacturing sector is in dire straits and you will continue to see an increase inplant shutdowns and company layoffs.  The Fed could continue to lower rates but there'llbe little capital investment if consumer spending dries up.  I feel we've just seen the beginning.  I think the Dow will be trading under 8000 by the end of April.Psychologically, the California crisis will add to consumer fear.  The crisis is not a short termproblem.  As a result, barring any Federal bailout, you could kiss that state's economy goodbye.Let me ask you a question; if you were paying (1) the highest real estate prices in the country, and (2) the highest energy prices for the least reliable power, in (3) the midst of a hi-tech meltdown, what wouldkeep you or your company from closing shop and moving to a different state??  If you own anyCA real estate, sell.  The only way to solve the CA energy crisis is to reduce demand or increase supply.Since CA doesn't want any power plants in its backyard, the supply issue likely won't be solved anytimesoon.  So, how do impact demand??  You have to price energy(power/gas) so high thatthe discretionary user (household, manufacturer, commercial store) conserves by closing its plant, cuttingback on the thermastat or running the commercial operation during off-peak hours.  California will seethis reduction in demand over time.  If the blackouts subside it's because so many businesses haveclosed their doors for good or moved to another state.  Without this, the blackouts will get much worse.If the state tries to get into the business of buying and selling electricity and gas, I would bet it will gobankrupt within 2-3 yrs.  Could you imagine the impact on the national economy from the bankruptcy of the U.S.'s most prosperous state.  Obviously this is only my opinion, but I would keep my eyes onthe energy markets - that's where the key to the turnaround lies.  Take Care and thanks for the email.Kevin

brilowery@aol.com,brilowery@aol.com,brilowery@aol.com,Subject: Re: Portable Generator,Great to hear from you.  Looking forward to meeting in Houston for a baseball game.Conway will be in Corpis soon so we should be able to do a weekend.  We should startconstruction on the house in May - what an incredibly long process it is.  I definitely wouldnot do it if I had to do it over again.  One redeeming factor is that we bought on a good block.  We definitely have the ugliest house on the block.  We should get a pop in realestate also when all the California companies start migrating to Texas.  Joking aside, unless you guys have incredibly mild weather this summer combined witha lot of rainfall, you're summer will suck.  There is no doubt that the CA economy is goingto suffer a great recession.  You have a shortage of supply so the only way to ease theproblem is to reduce demand.  This usually occurs when prices reach levels where the pricesensitive buyers cut back.  However, with your boy Grey Davis pushing for  price caps, this won'thappen.   The next way for demand to be trimmed is for companies to leave, so this will probablyneed to happen to an extent for the problem to ease.  The other factor, of course, is that youcould have an increase in supply - new power plants.  But being that the amt. of time it takes to develop and build a power plant in CA is about 3 times as long as in most other states combinedwith the fact that CA hasn't had a new power plant in the last 10 years, an increase in supplydoesn't seem likely in the short term.  Again, this is only my opinion, so you could take it witha grain of salt.  Talk to you soon.Kevin

I've neverseen such a cowardly performance by a baseball team (of course I'm talking abt theAstros).  When do you ever walk a guy with runners on 1st and 2nd, your team is down by 1 run and there is 2 outs?  Answer:  NEVER.  According to Dierker,"... the critical walk was the one with runners on first and second," Dierker said. "We did that because Jeff Kent was 3-for-17 against Williams and had struck out the last five at-bats (against him), so he showed some dominance against him. Obviously, you don't want to put another runner on base and move the runners another base in scoring position unless you have a very compelling reason, and we did.How's long's this clown been managing.  I guess he hasn't followed Kent the last few years.  It wasn't like he was walking Bonds to get to Ivan DeJesus.  He doesn't even have the sack to admit he fucked up.
