He doesn't attack early, I believe it is to build stone walls,	encompassing a larger area than is proportional for his team. And to seal us off.2) Large level of resources, enabling him to cue Paladins to build as his army is killed.	Thus he has a constant wave of attacks. He also builds resources until the pointhe decides to attack, then he kills all but maybe 20 villagers. His army is concentrated and huge.3) Build castles on conquered territory.If we wall a large area, build resource levels quickly, then attack as soon as we each have a40 man army, with additional soldiers cued. we will win. The use of trebuchets is imperative.We should have a total of 10 on our team. Towers kill.AND WE MUST NEVER SIT BACK AND LET HIM REBUILD. Whenever we hang out not attacking,it's over.J

We had a bad defensive game, which I hope turns around next week,as we have good people at those positions. Our defense has been one of the best.PumpnGD had a lucky defensive game, buthe has good people as well. Our head-to-head with him in 2 weeks is key. Curtis Martinis a bye for him, so he picked up Watters. But you saw last night how dominant ShaunAlexander is. If he has a good game next week, he may have the starting role or atleast split carries. The next 2 games will be tough.Jason

This past Sat I went to the Rennaisance Festival, which runsfor about 7 consecutive weekends in the fall every year in the country north of Houston.It is set up like a huge medieval village with jousting, shops, etc. People dress up like elves,swordsmen, wizards, fairies. (I even saw a fat guy dressed as a fairy) People are really intoit, and travel a long way to go.Have you seen the new Ford Thunderbird? Go online if you haven't, and have the big guy lookat it, too. I think it looks pretty awesome, but I'm not sure it will be my next car.Love,Jason
