He has turned down several invitations to join boards because he just can't commit the time.  So, while he is flattered by their interest, if and when Mr. Quackenbush calls we will decline.It was nice talking to you.

Don'tmiss this new and exciting event.  Make your reservations today.  Seemeeting details below.**********************************************Harvard University Club of Houston - Harvard Forum"Raising Children of Character in A World of Affluence"Dinner and Discussion ClubJoin us for a new type of Harvard Club experience.  Ever wanted to talksubstantively about a topic, while having a great dinner, but were afraidthat your dinner guests would not be able to go the distance with you inthe conversation?  We have the solution.Modeled after a format that members David and Anne Grizzle and DanguoleSpakevicius and William Altman have been enjoying for years, the HarvardForum will provide an opportunity for an extended conversation with fellowclub members.The format works like this:  we'll have dinner, and then a panel of Harvardgrads will give brief introductions to the evening's topic from theirperspective, and then we will all engage the topic for ourselves, first ina large group and then in small groups.  The panel members will beknowledgeable, but not so expert that anyone will be intimidated.  Theywill, however, be provocative to assure that the subsequent conversation islively.  You will come away knowing your fellow club members better thanever - maybe better than you ever wanted.The topic we've picked is one with which many of us have struggled.  Ourchildren may be growing up in a world far more affluent - privileged - thanwe enjoyed.  How imperiled is their character by our success?  Whatpractical steps can we take to insure that we pass along to them thecharacter values that we treasure?We plan to schedule a Harvard Forum every quarter.Because of the format, attendance is limited.  Please respond as indicatedbelow.When:    Friday, May 18, 7:30 p.m.Where:   Briar Club, 2603 Timmons (East Briar Room)Cost:      $35.00 per personReservations:  Email dottie@kerr-solutions.com or call 281/424-3084(Payment must be made at time of reservation by credit card or mailingcheck to 3413 Cobblestone Lane, Baytown, TX 77521-1956.)For further information, contact David Grizzle (david_grizzle@yahoo.com or713-324-2966) or Danguole Spakevicius (danguole@fempartners.com or713-665-4218).===================Dottie Kerr (harvardclub@kerr-solutions.com)Administrator for Harvard Club of Houstonwww.harvardclubofhouston.org

You'll be missed at Enron.Best regards,JeffJay Fitzgerald@ECT05/09/2001 08:55 AMTo:	Jeff Skilling/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc:	 Subject:	My Resignation, and a QuestionJeff-As you may know, I have (somewhat reluctantly) decided to resign from Enron.  For some time now, I have wanted to take some time off, and had asked Whalley about the possibility for a six month unpaid, unvested sabbatical.  Primarily for reasons of precedence, he was unwilling to pursue this option, which, while it is disappointing to me, I accept.The purpose of this note is twofold.First, I would like to thank you for making this company the great place it is today, and for giving me the opportunity to have a great career here.  I will forever look upon my nine plus years with Enron fondly.Second, I would like to ask you as the administrator of the 1997 Long Term Incentive Plan to allow me to explore opportunities in the venture capital community without triggering non-compete provisions with regard to future payouts.  I very much enjoyed my brief role in venture capital, and have some very good contacts in that area here in New York.  Since NetWorks decided to cease operations in that business earlier in the year, I should not think that Enron would view anything I might do there as competitive, especially if I were not working directly in the energy space with an Enron competitor.At present, I am planning to spend my time at least through the summer enjoying, and travelling with, my family.  I have nothing planned professionally as of yet, but wanted to take the opportunity to drop you this note while I might still be viewed positively (I hope that's not too presumptuous!).Please let me know your thoughts on this non-compete provision as I would not wish for anything to be awkward for us going forward.Again Jeff, thanks for many great memories, and as an Enron shareholder, keep up the great work!Jay

jeff_donahue@enron.net,jeff_donahue@enron.net,jeff_donahue@enron.net,Subject: Stanford/McKinsey GLOBE Survey,The Stanford Business School, in collaboration with the management-consulting firm McKinsey & Company, is conducting a large study of global corporations, their management practices, and organization.  Enron is participating in the project in order to learn how our own practices and activities compare to those of other leading global firms and to see which bring true benefits in the global marketplace.  One of the unique features of the project is that it seeks to assess the knowledge and communication networks within a company by asking employees throughout the company to comment on their actual practices and experience.  The goal is to obtain real and accurate information by surveying the people most directly involved in the company's operations. I would like to ask you to help us in getting the most out of our participation in the GLOBE Initiative by completing the GLOBE Network Survey.  The survey is brief and should take no longer than 15 or 20 minutes.  Your responses will be treated as strictly confidential, and will be used solely by the Stanford/McKinsey researchers to evaluate how specific practices and structures impact global communication and knowledge flows.  If you would like individual feedback on how your own networks compare to those of others in the study, please check the appropriate box at the end of the survey.  Please save this email for future reference and, again, thank you for contributing to this important learning opportunity.To complete the GLOBE Network Survey, please click on the link below and simply follow the survey instructions.  You will need to enter the Enron Company Code, which is: C673EVTo begin the survey, click on the link below: http://63.211.208.100/GLOBENetwork/survey.aspYou may also copy this link and paste it into your favorite browser.Thank you.

More generally, we've held Enron out as an example of ahighly accomplished company in all the areas Macerich is currently focusingon as an organization (operational integration, customer orientation,scalability, change leadership, and strategic focus).All of that being said, we would be extremely appreciative of anopportunity to have either Jeff Skilling or Dave Delainey speak at eitherof these conferences.  In any event, we're delighted that you would make aneffort to see if this can be put together.Relative to upcoming Macerich events, there are two scheduled:(1) University of Notre Dame Executive Education Program, May 7 - 9 inSouth Bend.  The curriculum is centered on change leadership and strategicthinking (officially "Enhanced Leadership and Strategy in the NewEconomy").  Attendees include our Executive Team (Art, David, Rick,Tom, Ed,and Larry Sidwell) and our Operating Team (17 SVPs).  There is also around-table discussion scheduled with our Board on May 9.(2) Macerich's Company Conference, June 4 - 7 in Park Cities, Utah.  Theemphasis of the conference will be on our "e-Business Transformation" (morespecifically on becoming wholly integrated across functional roles,customer facing, and highly scalable) and capturing value in our "ValueNetwork" (relationships we have with retailers, partners, vendors,shoppers, etc.)  The attendees for this event include the same people atUND as well as our managerial professionals from the malls and ourcorporate offices (about 250 people, total).Let me know if you need any additional background or information.Eric

Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...Sherri :-)

We had dinner a few days ago and he asked me if I thoughtyou might be interested in meeting with Ali Rodgrigues.  Ali will be in theUS sometimes in May and may be available to meet.  He and my buddy havebeen friends for years and I thought I'd extend the offer.  I don't know ifthere is an agenda or not.  Those guys are hard to read.  Just let me knowif it's something you want to do.  Otherwise I'll just forget about it.Keep that stock going up!-Stan

Jeff was very flattered and somewhat intrigued by your offer.  However, given the current demands on his time, he must respectfully decline your invitation.Please let me know if you have any interest in another senior-level representative of Enron speaking to your group, and I'll be happy to do what I can to facilitate that for you.Again, Mr. Morgan, thank you and the San Diego Chapter of YPO for the the opportunity.Regards,Sherri SeraAssistant to Jeff Skilling713.853.5984713.646.8381 (fax)sherri.sera@enron.com"Ronnie Morgan" <RonnieM@morgangroup.com> on 05/08/2001 02:33:06 PMTo:	<jeff.skilling@enron.com>cc:	"Michael S.
