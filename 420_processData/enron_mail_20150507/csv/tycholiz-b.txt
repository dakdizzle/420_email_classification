Nukes, water, tall buildings, stadiums,electrical generation assets, fuel depo's, crop dusters...

That is also with no ancillary deals behind this structure and that is what Lucci is trying to pull together. Paul, can you please investigate nom procedures, potential dry run structure ( Oct. 01) and verify what the structure looks like as the upstream diversions take place.( incl. default positions ).

The landscape of the shippers list is ever changing... Rumors of PPL pulling out 85,000/day to Malin and Stanfield is unconfirmed ( we are trying to validate)... and potentially Avista pulling out as they have been downgraded... they hold 35,000/day in 2003. Combined this is almost half of the planned expansion. Although not confirmed the bottom line is as the 03 shippers back out the expansion it becomes compromised and ultimately I believe the 2002 expansion and 2003 expansion start to blend together. As you guys know the 2002 shippers lists of 211,000 / day is made up 2 shippers Calpine 35,000/day and Newport Gen 175,000/day and this expansion has it's own issues.

The 30,000/day of capacity will sit on the books until next week but the deal with HUBER is effectively completed. In the event that this deal does not close, then the West desk will resume with the same MTM risks that you presently have.  Any curve shift positive from now until the transaction is actually unwound will be credited back to the orig desk and any negative curve shift from here on in will be credited to the trading desk... plus ENA Orig and trading will work on a sharing calculation payable for any future deals. In addition to the transportation income being generated, additional orig will be generated by entering into wellhead and market based transactions with the desks. I believe that all of the risks and discussions associated with the structures have been well communicated with each book ( by Mark Whitt ) and we will be meeting with each of you early next week to get the structures and booking set up properly.I trust that this note covers the general areas related to this deal and I am very pleased with the high level of cooperation shown by everyone..Pls review file and if there are any questions give me a call.BT

lreid@sppc.com,lreid@sppc.com,lreid@sppc.com,Subject: FW: SPPC1.xls,Lorelie, attached is a Price Distribution table that is set up as a template for SPPC Power load as it relates to market prices  and load.  As you can see, this distribution protects your rate base against a rising price environment and partially floats with market prices as they move down.  The distribution ( fixed price vs floating ) may move up a percent or two in relation to the outright price desk that we face today ( relative to the historical numbers) but those iterations can be made as required.Pls review and we can discuss at your convenience.Also, as discussed, I am looking for ways to enhance our ability to transact with you on gas structures but in light of the overall credit positions that may be difficult.  With that being said however, I do believe that we can stream some structures to the physical contracts in gas and ensure that from the physical point of view ENA and SPPC are both protected and I would like to pursue this with you. One area that I would like to start with to have SPPC sell ENA physical gas ( 30,000/40,000/day) against a physical gas daily related price.  Once I have accumulated a payables position, we inherently create a secured line without having to change any of the contracts/paper currently in place.  I am also sure this will require further discussions and look forward to catching up with you soonest.regards, Barry Tycholiz

I have been talking with our in house legal and with Canada and I know Eric and yourself have also been talking. I believe that the door has been pushed open a little and if everyone tries to get these agreements cleaned up  and executed that PG&E and Enron ( Canada & US ) can start to transact.With that being said, there are two areas which I would like to refresh from our discussions..1.  Did you give any further thought to the utilization of Daily gas sales as a collateral.. I truly believe that this vehicle is a very efficient,easy way for PG&E to enhance the credit with ENA and once we have a 30 day bucket... we can get you trading access to EOL.  Lot's of details to work out, but I would like to keep this discussion at the forefront. I can send the details of how this proposal would work if required. ( let me know ) 2.  As discussed, ENA holds some 5 year El Paso capacity. I am looking to assign this capacity and possibly and would like to investigate your supply requirements and possible alternatives such that you can consider our capacity.

s..bradford@enron.com,s..bradford@enron.com,s..bradford@enron.com,Subject: PG&E Credit authorization,Bill,as requested,  I talked to Michael Tribolet last week and he felt that transactions under 1 year would be ok with PG&E Company . I would like to take the next step with them and assuming we get paper executed for ECC and ENA ( which is pending).... I want to give them TRADE ACCESS TO EOL.  Cumulative unsecured exposure would be about $300,000/day. ( estimated ) and  I would try to get the payments from them to us made on the 5th business day vs the 25th business day following delivery. Our master will give us rights for reasonable financial assurances but not definative collateral threshold amount, infact we should keep this at zero for both sides until the air clears. All transactions will come through EOL and the products being sold by ENA, ECC will be cash or rest of month, AECO, Sumas, Malin or PG&E Citygate.The bottom line on this is do we want to enter into Gas related cash transactions that increase of exposure on a receivables basis to PG&E.  Commercially, I believe they are someone we want to do business with and we can increase deal flow on EOL for some Canadian and U.S. products. I do not think we are in a position today to ask for pre-pays.  Please advise if any questions otherwise I am seeking the GREEN Light from you to take the next step.regards, BT

Having them take this pipe as a vehicle to help offset our bankruptcy claim works from an economics point of view ( assuming you can agree on values), but I think you will have a battle regaring the quality of service that they are going to get.

Also, they have valued the inventories off of the Nymex only ( or so it appears) and I would have to believe that the value of these molecules is materially different than this. Pls review and let's discuss asap.BT

bbrunel@smud.com,bbrunel@smud.com,bbrunel@smud.com,Subject: Tranportation Discussions,Barry, trust all is well. I just wanted to update you on a couple of things and re-check SMUD's interest.1. The on again off again PGT assignment of 10,000 MMBTU per day out of Nov. 2002. appears to have surfaced from our counter party again and under the assumption you are still interested I will forward to you latest offer once we have FIRMED it up with the third party. 2. It is my understanding that you own El Paso - PG&E Topock capacity until May 31, 2003.  ENA has some of the same capacity and is prepared to offer this into the market place from the period June 1, 2003 - May 30, 2006. ( with the renewal rights), PLUS some sort of " Payment " from ENA to SMUD.  Rather than renew your existing capacity at full tolls, this is a way to pick up transport below the normal tariff and retain renewal rights after 2006. Pls advise if either of these points capture your interest. Thanks in advance, Barry Tycholiz

I talked to Bradford this a.m. regarding another matter and managed to discuss with him general credit terms for PG&E. He said he would review Post Petition credit status and also needs to discuss these credit lines as potentially part of our ongoing issues related to PG&E. He was going to discuss internally and advise.I am not sure he will have any comments back by this weds, so this may conflict with the timelines Eric and I discussed this a.m.BT

As previously discussed seeing the DWR rfp will require some credit and contract enhancements and that process is underway but it is moving slower and with less push than I would like... For sure, there are alot of hurdles...It is our opinion that any transactions that are being done by the DWR with third parties are relatively short dated..  1 month, 2 month etc.. but we will keep you posted as we move forward.BT
