m..presto@enron.com,m..presto@enron.com,m..presto@enron.com,Subject: ,Under new rules instituted this year by Commissioner Bud Selig, an umpire can automatically eject a pitcher if he believes he's throwing at a batter. He does not have to issue a warning before an ejection. Fletcher did not warn Mann for hitting Gonzalez or Cordova. "The umpire said Bartolo threw the ball at his head and that's an automatic ejection," said Manuel. "But the ball missed his head by three feet. It tipped off his bat." Colon said he wasn't trying to hit Servais. "I will protect my teammates," said Colon, speaking through bullpen coach/interpreter Luis Isaac. "I can hit anyone I want at any time. That's why I feel bad. I wasn't trying to hit him. The ball slipped." Fryman defended his pitcher. "At no point, do I approve of throwing at someone's head," said Fryman. "But that pitch did not surprise anyone in the ballpark. Bartolo should not have been ejected. There should have been an immediate warning to each bench.

It builds on Offset to Last Trade functionality.The simplified description is: It tracks two variables: Intensity(Speed) and Bias (Buy or Sell emphasis).  As Intensity increases, the Spread increases. As Bias increases, the Offset increases.I'll call later to see what you think of the idea.Dave Program CriteriaThe formula which defines the trading decision-making program will need to work with several criteria/inputs/definitions. These might be:Intensity (Speed) - The average time between transaction attempts, regardless of whether they are buys or sells. Measured as a moving average over the last [Intensity Factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction Tibco messages for the Product.Obviously, the lower the Intensity calculation, the higher the transaction flow. Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow.Intensity Factor - The number of transactions to be included in the moving average Intensity calculation. A possible value for this might be [4].#Buys - The number of Buys which have occurred.#Sells - The number of Sells which have occured.Transaction Count - Could be either #Buys or #Sells (whichever last occured).}Buy Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs.Sell Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs.Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR)- The amount by which the Buy Offset should be reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the ORR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be 1.Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR)- The amount by which #Buys should be reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount #Sells should be reduced if a Buy occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the TRR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal to 1.Spread Minimum - The minimum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this might be [0.04]Spread Maximum - The maximum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this might be [0.50]Offset Minimum - The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A possible value for this might be [0].Offset Maximum -The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A possible value for this might be [0.50]Initial Offset - The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is startedInitial Spread - The Spread used when the program is startedSpread-Offset Minimum - The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed Offset. Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer. A possible value for this might be [0.01]Dead Interval - The period of time which must pass before the program will recalculate the above Criteria, if no transactions have taken place during the Dead Interval. A possible value for this might be [240] seconds.Program OutputsThe program should output the following variables as a result of combining the above Criteria in a user-defined Formula:Spread (integer) - as per current Stack ManagerOffset (integer) - as per current Stack ManagerSuspension (boolean) - Whether or not the Product should be suspended. Normally "False"Program Interface and Operation PrinciplesThe user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a relationship among the above Criteria, which will produce and apply the Outputs to a particular Product. This relationship would be defined with Intensity Formulas and Transaction Formulas. Every time a Transaction occurs, or a Dead Interval passes, the Criteria will be recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the program. If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place, then Intensity = Intensity +240 and #Buys=#Buys-TRR and #Sells=#Sells-TRR and Buy Offset = Buy Offset- ORR and Sell Offset = Sell Offset - ORR. If the user-defined Formulas (see following) indicate that a change in spread should occur, then if the Offset is zero (in the case of a trade occurring) or if no trade has occured (during the passing of a Dead Interval), the system shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last transaction, adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread value.Any adjustment to the Spread shall respect the Spread-Offset Minimum. If a reduction in the Spread should violate the Spread-Offset Minimum, then the Buy Offset (or Sell Offset, or both as appropriate) shall be reduced accordingly. Similarly, if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula to a level greater than the Spread, the Spread shall be increased to maintain the Spread-Offset Minimum.GUI/Formulas Example:ConstantsIntensity Factor: [4]Dead Interval: [240]Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR): [0.3]Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR): [0.3]Spread Minimum [0.04]Spread Maximum [0.50]Offset Minimum [0]Offset Maximum [0.49]Spread-Offset Minimum [0.01]		       INPUTS		         OUTPUTSIntensity FormulaFormula #	Intensity			Spread	Offset  SuspensionS1		>220			-0.01	n/a	FS2		<30			+0.01	n/a	FS3		<10			+0.02	n/a	FTransaction FormulaFormula #	# Transactions		Spread	Offset  SuspensionV1		<4			n/a	-0.01	FV2		>3			n/a	+0.01	FV3		>5			+0.01	+0.02	FV4		>10			+0.02	+0.04	FV5		>15			+0.04	+0.15	FV6		>20			n/a	n/a	T				Note that #Transactions would be #Buys or #Sells, as appropriate. Note also that #Buys and #Sells are not intended to be an absolute count, but rather are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently occured.In this example, all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through the GUI.SimulationObviously, if we want to proceed, we will want to conduct several simulations to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness. However, to give some idea of how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular direction, please see the attached: Additional FeaturesSystem NotificationsThere should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader, which will be similar to Stack Manager Garbage Checks: Warning and Failure levels for both Offset and Price. The warning levels will trigger a pager message. The Failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be automatically suspended. The Price checks will be against prices input by the trader (not relative price movements, but actual price). There should be both maximum and minimum price checks (e.g. gas is trading at $5.50. The notification levels could be $8 at the top end and $2 at the bottom end). Offset checks will only be against a maximum value.Dave

ECB can come out and transfer some of its foreign reserves from dollars to Euros, but they are limited by their currency reserves unless they want to act in the futures market at which point they have to exit that position at some point.  i think it is more psychological than anything.  i think overall market interventions have been extremely ineffective.

Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number atthe end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number isallowed, not an algebraic equation.Acquiring a Company	In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means ofa tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's sharesbut are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oilexploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very viabilityof Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, thecompany under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But ifthe project succeeds, the value of the company under current managementcould be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 areconsidered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worthconsiderably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the companywill be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than underCompany T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under eithermanagement.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value undercurrent management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A,and so on.	The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the pricethey should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at aprofitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, thepotential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T todelay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, thenaccept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reachesthe press.	Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration projectwhen submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results whendeciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T willaccept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value ofthe company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, forinstance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T isanything less than $50.	As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price offersin the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T'sstock?	$______ per/share

CNBC:  the business viewpoint.  ESPN: the sports viewpoint.  Pat Robertson Channel: God's viewpoint.  The politicians all hold news conferences and talk for 15 minutes and say nothing.  "We interrupt the State Dept's news conference to bring you the Justice Dept's news conference where we expect there going to say 'no comment at this time' frequently."  I have a tv on my desk at work that is on constantly just in case something happens, but meanwhile it's driving me nuts.Just found out another girl I knew is missing. I was supposed to go out with this girl a couple years ago on a blind date but it never went through.  I met her after that.  So let's talk about something better.  We'll start shallow.  What kind of music do you like?  John

Despite the fact that Eva referred you, we would have interest in meeting with you about emplyment opps. I was planning on going to NY in a couple weeks but at this point, I don't know.  I would highly recommend that you follow the formal recruitment program in addition to any talks we have.  Although I can recommend to make you an offer, it is much easier if it is done in parallel with the associate recruitment program.  After the current events calm down, we can talk via phone about my experience here and why I think there are some good opportunities here.

caroline.abramo@enron.com,caroline.abramo@enron.com,caroline.abramo@enron.com,Subject: RE: ICE,Hey:1.  Theoretically we could agree upon a trade and cross it on ICE after hours when the risk that someone else gets inside is remote.  This is a prearranged trade and is illegal on Nymex, but it is my understanding it will be legal on ICE assuming ICE uses the IPE clearing platform, where prearranged trading is legal.   Agree about liquidity.  I dont think this really helps ICE's volumes, nor liquidity.  Funds want liquidity so they will not flock to ICE in the current state.  2.  My guess is not intercommodity, but maybe intracommodity.  For instance, a gas daily swap against front month futures may have lower margin than the 2 trades additive.  Important Note: ICE is our competition and I am very,very wary to support their system, unless absolutely necessary.

The work that Dave Forster did was just for front month.  That creates month 1.  Then, similar logic has to create a month 1/month 2 spread to create a month 2 outright market.   Same for month 2/ month 3 to create month 3.  There might be 24-36 individual markets to create a forward curve.  Sometimes month 1 has correlation to the month 1/ month 2 spread.  Sometimes it does not.  Must create a system that is mechanical but very easy for a human to add bias.

Havent had internet access at home for past 5 weeks.  Much easier to write these at home as when I'm done trading I don't want to look at my computer.  For november, very neutral.  Cash is impressive.  Agree shutins, switching, and some weather are making market look more like equilibrium.  Think with cash/futures at 20 cents, x/z looks crazy.  As soon as z becomes prompt, the fear factor/risk premium of it will decrease and the whole winter will come off.  Like your h/j trade.  Hard to see it really being worth 9 cents at settlement.  Been buying a lot of y/y cantango as I think next summer will be a piece but longer term gas story still very real and customers know it.  Wouldnt be surprised to see 2/3 go to 50+.  I think x has some room to go up, but not a lot.  Dont want to play the market from the long side as been burned before trying to get long a market that is still in a downtrend.  Seems like the curve will just keep rolling down with each expiry.  All the winter months might settle 2.25.  As such, the best thing to be short is jan.

It may be a good time to move the 3-10 to a cal 2 trade.  Pira just gave their seasonal conference in NY and they are very bullish long term gas.	Pira's	forecast		Nymex Cal 2 	2.45		2.99Cal 3	3.00		3.31	Cal 4	3.70		3.40Cal 5	4.00		3.48Cal 6	4.10		3.57Cal 7	4.20		3.66Cal 8	4.30		3.75Cal 9	3.60		3.84		(TransAlaska Highway Pipeline)Cal 10	3.80		3.933-10	3.84		3.59Regardless of what you think of Pira and long term price forecasts, the rest of the market does listen.  They have a tremendous amount of respect in the industry and affect how customers and producers hedge.  The flow, which has been buyers over for the way backs, I think will get more pronounced, especially if the front goes down.  In the past week, I've sold Duke 40,000/d Cal 6-10 and 25,000/d Cal 7-10.  I've sold PGE maybe 30,000 day Cal 4-5.  The only seller has been El Paso whom I believe is hedging production.  He is trying to pressure the y/y spreads as a spec trade that I think was/is being done to front run the corp hedges.  I've used it as an opportunity to put a lot of spreads away for inventory down the road.  If you want to buy this strip back in the next 6 months, I think it's going to be much easier/cheaper to roll it closer.

The balance, $123,000,  is almost exactly $.01 bid/mid, which I think is pretty fair considering the tenor of the deal and that it included price and vol.

Do not believe we've seen the worst yet.Will not be looking to put more money to work on the long only side for a while.  Even with the rally today I do not believe we've seen the worst yet."Gapinski, Michael" <michael.gapinski@ubspainewebber.com> on 04/17/2001 08:48:53 AMTo:	"'John.Arnold@enron.com'" <John.Arnold@enron.com>cc:	"Herrera, Rafael J." <rafael.herrera@painewebber.com> Subject:	RE: Receipt of Hedge Fund InformationJohn -Yes, we received your check and forms.  The check has been deposited and theforms have been processed.  The actual debits for hedge fund subscriptionswill begin on April 24th.As for naked options, I believe we sent the paperwork for naked options toyou in February, but I don't believe we got it back.  Also, I'm concernedabout the margin requirements for naked options interfering with fundsavailable for the hedge fund subscriptions on April 24th.I also have an ACCESS manager portfolio presentation for you to reviewconcerning the long-stock portion of your portfolio.  I'm thinking we couldknock out the paperwork, discuss protecting your liquidity for the hedgefunds vs. naked option margin requirements, and walk you through the ACCESSmanager proposal in about 30-45 minutes if you're available around 5 PMtonight or tomorrow night.  With regards to the marginable equity for nakedoptions question, are the stocks at Fidelity held in joint name?Thanks,Mike

Would that be you?  Or do you have a legal department that we should forward it to?  We initially changed the name on it and had it signed under Enron Corp which is where the majority of our Bloomberg contracts lie, but becauseyou can actually execute trades from the system that you are now using, it has to be under your departments nameand we need someone to sign the contract.Let me know.Thanks,Julie
