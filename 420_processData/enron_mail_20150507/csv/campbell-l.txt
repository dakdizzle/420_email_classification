I saw a picture of Dustin's deer, pretty nice.  someone from BLM told me a deer came in from the sandhills east of town that was 29" and non typical.  I also heard of some deer that were taken north of town that were pretty nice also (16-24"). Dont you think it s funny that we spend all kinds of money and time traveling to all our secret spots and the big ones are right in our back yard? Im planning on taking some time off for the holidays, so If I dont hear from you have a wonderful Christmas and keep your focus on the Lord, He's our only salvation.  So often we look to other things to give us security and joy and we so often forget, that for those that love Him and have confessed Him as our Savior He is our strength and hope of a future eternal glory.....May God be your source of strength, Merry Christmas...

I found out he became a believer about a couple of months ago and I have been spending a little time sharing Christ with him.  Im sure hes going through a tough period now.  If you saved his address you may want to congraulate him into the family.  Thanks for the prayers.  Its funny, but Im not too shook up about this.  what ever happens happens and I know I cant do anything about it.  It must the the Spirit within me, but Im relatively calm about the whole situation.  I find that when I hang aroundthe guys in the office and we start gripping, I loose my focus and start looking like a carnal Christian.  So Im better off away from the troops and just trnding to business.  Bill Kendrick seems to be pretty focused also. Im glad for that.  I know hes under a lot of stress.     It seems the people tied to the pipeline assets are the safest.  If it is a business unit with income coming in, Enron wants you.  The gossip and garbage going around about what and how Enron is going to do to bail itself out is rampant.  I just know that there arent too many people loyal to Enron right now. Many fortunes and retirements have been lost and many of those who had retired in the last several months are trying to get back on with the different companies.   Someone said 4500 people in Enron Houston were given pink slips.  This is a bad time for all with Christmas around the corner, but then maybe, just like September 11, maybe its another wake up call for people to understand that the things in this world arent very stable and reliable.  I hope that this turns many to Jesus.  Another one of those Romans 8:28 passages which seems to have direct relevance right now.  If you can, say a prayer for those that arent employeed anymore and feel like they have lost everything.  Hope your holidays will be blessed with some of your family coming in. Do you have plans to do any downhill skiing in Quatar over Christmas....

If Cubix is willing to provide us a report that shows the load on 703 to be greater than 90%, we've satisified the compliance testing for 703.  Id like to have a copy of the revised report to submit to the Air Quality Bureau for their records and the facility should also have copy.  My records show that the ceiling for using unit 702 is 68% load.  Under our agreement with the AQB, we can operate unit 702 ONLY UP TO A 68% LOAD.  Above this, we need to bring in Cubix or have a portable test completed to raise the ceiling of operation.  One other thing, there seem to be some confusion about which units are required to be tested at station 7.  I have a copy of the approval from the AQB about allowing us to test units 702 and 703 instead of 701 and 702.  Ill pass a copy of this letter on to anyone who needs it. 
ayers@qp.com.qa,ayers@qp.com.qa,ayers@qp.com.qa,Subject: Merry Christmas,David got your voice mail last week.  Sorry about not getting to talk with you, but I am taking the month of December off so as not to give Enron my vacation.  Im not going to give it away anymore.  I would have liked to talked to you.  Things are somewhat stressful around here.  Probably worse in Houston.  Enron is screening  e mails so everyone is a little tense. Lots of things are going on with Enron trying to bail itself out of this mess.  As you may have heard, they severed about 4500 people so far, Joe Kolb and Don Stevens were among those.  Ive kept a low key on the daily news reports about what is going on, so I really dont know much.  This was a good time to take my vacation.  This whole thing doesnt seem to be bothering me, as I am relying on Jesus, my higher power and that has been my strength and comfort. Its a good feeling to know that whatever happens, my family and I will be just fine.Hows Christmas in the desert? Were you able to find an acceptable substitute for a tree?  this was a good time for you to stretch your wings.David, I hope you and everyone in the Ayers household has a very merry Christmas.  I think of you much and hold you in my prayers.  When we stop and reflect upon all that man has done to warp the meaning of our Savior's birth, it becomes hard to focus on the real meaing.  I pray that you are a wonderful witness to a lost and twisted people  in Katar and remember the love of Christ that was revealed to us in his cruxificion.  I am thankful for our Great High Priest who has opened up the doors of heaven for us and by His Spirit has given us the opportunity to peek through the veil and know the Holies of Holies.  May God bless each of you and continue to show you wonders of His love and grace.Merry Christmas, Your brother in Christ

I know in the past, prior to their taking over ownership, I would remind them each year that a particular document was requried.  I figured that when they became owners, they didnt need me anymore.  Louie, you are right, Phil Moyer was the environmental contact for WGR and he was the one I would contact and apprise.  It just so happens that I have copies of previous annual submittals from WGR for the Gomez facility  when the facility was under our ownership, their responsibility.  I even have a copy of the Title V Permit.  When I was told that we no longer owned the faclity, I sent all information I had to WGR, but kept copies of the stuff I had, just in case.  I can send it one more time if you want me too.  Let me know.....

The EPA has completed is review of these state permits an=d has sent them back to the ADEQ for comment.  I have spoken to Shudeish, t=he permit engineer for the ADEQ, and he is reviewing EPA's comments as this= e mail is being written.  He will give me a call when his review is comple=te, but he does not anticipate any major issues which cant be resolved prio=r to the public hearing.  These permits went out for public notice on Octob=er 15 and 16, which means that the comment period ends on Nov. 15 and 16.  =The ADEQ plans on holding the public hearing for both permits on monday Nov=. 19 in Williams AZ. at 7:00 pm.  I plan on being there.  Williams is locat=ed approx. 30 miles west of Flagstaff, AZ.  The address for the hearing is =the Council Chambers located at 113 south 1st street.  So far, there have b=een no responses submitted to the ADEQ by the public.  In EPA's review proc=ess, they  had a problem with methodology proposed by Transwestern for meas=uring sulfur in the fuel gas.  We had proposed stain tubes in the custom fu=el monitoring schedule, they wanted us to do wet chemistry.  We convinced t=hem otherwise (Byron, because of this, you wont need to order a sulfur anal=yzer for the Needles facility.  This should save you about $40K).  There wa=s also an issue with manufacturers quarantees regarding particulate matter =emissions from the turbine and catepillar.  This has been resolved also.Stations 3 and 4.  I received a call from Roger Kohn, the permit engineer f=or the EPA.  He is satisified with the permit application contents and has =also approved stain tubes for the sulfur measurement at these locations.  T=here are no outstanding issues on these permits from the EPA.  The public c=omment period for the Station 3 and 4 permits ends Nov.  3.  After this dat=e, it will take 1-2 weeks for the Regional Administrator of the EPA to sign= off on the permits  and then he will have them issued to Transwestern.  As= of this date, there have been no comments submitted to the EPA for the per=mits for station 3 and or 4.Ill keep everyone apprised of future events.

SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for $120,602.19.  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating expenses for PCB activities in California.The public hearing was held in Williams, AZ for the Kingman and Flagstaff air permits under the Redrok Expansion.  There were no comments or concerns brought up at the meeting as no individuals came to the meeting.  An email was received from the ADEQ presenting the minor additions which will be added to each permit.  Each comment and addition will not impact or change the draft permits which were received earlier this month.  The permits for Klagetoh and Luepp were received from the EPA last week.  The permits from the ADEQ for the Kingman and Flagstaff C/S will be issued the later part of this week. Attended the incident investigation and technical writing workshop in Omaha.Assisted the Mountainair team with the semiannual Title V compliance monitoring report  for C/S No.7.A meeting was held in Phoenix, Az with PG&E to review charges and invoices by PG&E for PCB management and disposal activities on their system for the last several months.   Also discussed was recent liquids sampling results and proposed PCB activities on the PG&E system for 2002.

I spoke with Danny Collier of the EPA today, Friday, November 30, 2001 and he has instructed me that the EPA is to receive copies of all monthly water well sampling for C/S 3,4, and 5 in addition to sending the monthly sampling results to Yolanda Barney of the Navajo Nation. Although Yolanda is the primary recipient, the EPA becomes secondary as they have the responsibility for oversight of Indian Lands environmental issues.  Danny said that the EPA would eventually phase themselves out of the Navajo's business but until they do, he is requesting copies of all sampling data.  I asked him if we could fax him the monthly reports and he indiacted that it would be OK to do so.  His fax number is (415) 947-3549.  I will keep you apprised of any future changes in the distribution of the water sampling reports.

I spoke with Danny about this and he said that the EPAs involvement would start  to deminish in the future but he didnt when.

I never thought I d see the Enron empire tumble, but when you torture and strangle a corporation hard enough and long enough, eventually it gives up and surrenders.  There is a push underway to isolate the pipelines from the Enron umbrella and make all business units with money making assets separate from the rest of Enron.  Transwestern is definately a money making asset, and that is what may keep me afloat.  Well see.

The liquids that are generated in the 8" line are exempt from hazardous waste regulations (RCRA) as long as they stay in the Duke line and are not transfered and collect in a mainline tank.  Because WT-1 is a mainline compressor station, any chemicals or compounds which are regulated under Subtitle C of RCRA  become the responsibility of the owner of the mainline tank.  Within the past few years, we have experienced the collection of regulated liquids at Wt-1 which were not placed there by Tranwestern.  Chemicals which producers and processing, upstream of Wt-1, have placed downhole to enhance gas production and other agents such as corrosion inhibitors and pipeline solvents have found their way into our tank and we have paid for the disposal.  Unfortunately, there is no way to segregate the bad materials from the good recycleable materials.Based upon this, I would recommend that we not allow Dukes pipeline liquids to collect into our tank.
