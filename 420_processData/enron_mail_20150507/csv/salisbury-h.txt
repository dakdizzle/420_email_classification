Available for delivery in Houston and Dallas, the product is offered by Enron in the over-the-counter market and via Clickpaper.com, Enron's Internet-based transaction system dedicated to the forest products industry. The first transaction was completed via Clickpaper.com on March 14 with a major lumber buyer in the southern United States. This represents the first online fixed price transaction contract in the industry. With the growing volatility in the lumber industry, the availability of a long-term fixed price product provides companies with another opportunity to mitigate their exposure. Additionally, this transaction represents the convergence of Enron's increasing involvement in physical lumber transactions with our recognized expertise in financial risk management.In addition, EIM has announced that it has completed its acquisition of the Quebec City, Canada newsprint mill and related assets from Daishowa Forest Products Ltd. In July 2000, Enron purchased Garden State Paper, a recycled newsprint mill located in Garfield, NJ. The acquisition of the Daishowa mill now positions Enron as the seventh largest producer of newsprint in North America. The Daishowa mill in Quebec City will now be called Papiers Stadacona. The new name has great historical significance to the local community in Quebec City. When Jacques Cartier first explored the mouth of the St. Charles River in 1535, the aboriginal people living there referred to the village as Stadacona. This is now the site of modern-day Quebec City. Enron Freight MarketsIn March, Enron Freight Markets (EFM) completed the acquisition of Webmodal, Inc to help launch the traditional intermediary transportation business.  EFM also started its spot trading business and completed 981 transactions in its first month.East Power OriginationOn Tuesday, April 3, the St. Lucie County Commission voted 3-2 to approve the Midway Energy Center near Fort Pierce, Florida, which is a 510 megawatt peaking power plant.  Next steps for this facility include receiving a water permit from the South Florida Water Management District and an Environmental Resource Permit (ERP) from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.Enron CanadaKen Lay addressed a breakfast meeting of the Toronto Board of Trade on Wednesday, April 4, as part of the "Power Breakfast Series".  His topic was "Moving Forward with Electricity Deregulation."  Before his speech, the chairman of the Board of Trade commented that "this was the best attendance ever" at one of their breakfast meetings.  After the meeting, Mr. Lay spoke with reporters from Reuters, the Globe and Mail, the National Post, and Report on Business TV emphasizing Enron's commitment to deregulation of the Ontario power market.IN THE NEWSJAPAN: Enron presents power plant plan to Japan governmentTOKYO, U.S.-based Enron Corp on Wednesday presented plans to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) fired power plant in northern Japan, aiming to become the first foreign company to build such a plant in Japan. The move brings Enron one step closer to realizing its plan to build a power plant with an initial capacity of two million kilowatts in Aomori prefecture."We submitted our basic plan to build the plant to the governor of Aomori prefecture today in line with last November's announcement," Tatsuro Seguchi, president of Enron Corp's Japanese affiliate Encom Corp, told a news conference. "We are aiming to start construction of the plant in 2004 and start operations by 2007 since Japan's power market is one of our highest priorities," he said.    03/28/2001  Reuters English News Service   (C) Reuters Limited 2001.WELCOMENew HiresEGM  - Lyelle Bellard, Damian Nelson, Edward Soo, Jonathan WhiteheadEIM   - Elsa Aguilar, Melia Dickson, John Hark, Phaedra Jones, Maricar Jose, Ian McCrory, Mirella Bertrone, Roland Holub, Arthur Miller, Miriam Watson,            Richard Albert, Randy Biagini, Thomas Duchnicki, Diego TabbachinoENA  - Mitra Mujica, Karen Phillips, Sarah Domonoskie, Kelly Donlevy-LeeTransfers (to or within) ENA - John Moore, Mitchell Robinson, Larry Valderrama, Holden Salisbury, Grace Rodriguez, Mary Martinez, Dominic Carolan, Kari Oquinn, Katherine Kelly,   	David Fuller, Anguel Grigorov, Oren Zimmerman, Chuanli Deng, Glenn Surowiec, Tharsilla Broussard, Geynille Dillingham, Philip Conn, Lola Weller, 		Christina Brandli, Noemi Camacho, Randel Young, Ina RangelEGM - Shelia Benke, Homer Lin, William McKone, William Berkeland, Valarie Curry, Tomas TellezEIM - Allen Ueckert, John W.

After spending hours on the phone with CISO and PAC John @ PACE found that this tag had been replaced by tag 16381N   but none knew anything about it. This tag was for 78 MW and it was done by a PACE prescheduler.  We were trying to find a new sink in the meantime so before this new tag was found the following went RTHE 01 78 MW to APS  (APS took the power)HE 02 sank with LADWP @ $0. I agreed with John at PACE that we are going to charge PAC for HE 1-2 LDsThen for HE 3-6  the power was sent to PACE for the original deal price at PV.John at PACE was going to leave good notes to his prescheduler about this cut. I did not do anything HA to manage the cut (in enpower, Lotus notes ) as JOhn at PACE did not consider this a HA cut but a DA cut that nobody knew about. We left it up to the preschedulers to agree on this cut.if you have questions ask me,Monika

An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.Participants attending this seminar will be able to:Formulate customer hedge strategies based on a solid understanding of risk; its impact on capital structures and approaches to its mitigation.Develop and interpret forward prices in the context of arbitration disciplines, as well as understand the divergences from these disciplines that are characteristic of energy prices.Identify marketing opportunities through an understanding of both the forward curve and the distortions created by the physical system of production and transportation.Assemble the pricing of a transaction from a benchmark price curve.Devise cost-reducing deal structures for gas storage from an understanding of price curves and their components.Exploit differences in locational pricing with insights into the relationship between basis and transportation/transmission.Structure a natural gas and power swap to hedge a company's risk position, explaining its risks and benefits as a risk management tool.Price a swap from the price curve and customize the structure to meet various customer needs including earnings, cash flow and embedded financing. Apply basis swaps to either mitigate locational risk or to achieve a more favorable risk/reward position by altering the index location.Attain a fluency in language concepts and hedging application of options.Package strips of options to create caps, floors and zero-premium collars.Create structures that provide energy users with sub-index pricing using embedded options.Recognize options embedded in common supply contracts and their pricing implications, including swing, double-ups and index contracts with maximum prices, etc.
