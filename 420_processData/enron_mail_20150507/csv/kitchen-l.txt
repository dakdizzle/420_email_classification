david.zaccour@enron.com,david.zaccour@enron.com,david.zaccour@enron.com,Subject: RE: MBA Question for Louise,A.  EnronOnline has been a extremely successful e-Commerce project in the energy industry.  As of September 14, 2001, it has completed over 1.4 million transactions worth $800 billion.  Currently, 60% of Enron's transactions are done via EnronOnline and the company's transaction costs have been reduced by 75%.    Our business model for leveraging the internet has proved invaluable and is inherently strong.  We built EnronOnline in collaboration with input from commercial as well as technological experts.  Over the past 22 months, we have successfully the EnronOnline e-commerce platform to:  1) Access new markets and customersIn addition to enhancing its Natural Gas and Power businesses, EnronOnline has enabled Enron to get into other markets, for example, broadband, paper, freight, metals, weather, petrochemicals, and even financial instruments from all over the world.  The system has been instrumental in reaching many more customers than previously possible via telephone or face-to-face meetings.  2) Manage high volume of products and transactionsEnron does more than 5,000 online transactions in an average day.  Before EnronOnline, a buyer might have needed to make numerous phone calls to hunt down prices; now s/he can go to EnronOnline and instantly buy or sell a commodity at a market-driven price, with no transaction fee.  The easier price discovery attracts more companies to EnronOnline.  More trading builds liquidity and more liquidity tends to narrow bid and offer spreads, resulting in better prices and more deals for Enron.To paraphrase Smart Business (September 2001), a long-term gas contract, that in 1981 took two years to execute, and in 1997 took two weeks - now takes less than a second online [thanks in part, to EnronOnline].  Because of the technology and software EnronOnline has developed, it is relatively easy for Enron to add new products to trade online, further making it easier to move into new markets without having to wait for long lead-times required to develop new systems. 3) Improve Competitive Position And Bottom LineEnronOnline has truly differentiated itself in the industry by using the internet effectively.  The results have been widely reported in the media.  Internet Week (October 2000): "Enron is a company that fundamentally transformed itself on the Internet - having whipped its existing businesses into online ones, ridden the Net into many new markets, added $60 billion in revenue last fiscal year, and has beaten Wall Street earnings forecasts in the first two quarters of this year . . . [Enron's] second quarter net income rose 40% from the year-earlier quarter to $404 Million, on 196 percent higher revenue of $50 billion . . . the Internet trading marketplace Enron launched in late 1999 is allowing the company to pounce on market conditions with startling efficiency. EnronOnline now does more than $4 billion a day in trades, in everything from coal and steel to storage services and weather derivatives. Enron was praised in Smart Business magazine (September 2001) as No. 1 of the "Smart Business Fifty" list for successfully embracing the Net to expand and enhance the business.  Forrester Research (Forrester Report April 2001) predicts online energy trading will explode from a $400 billion market in 2000 (with EnronOnline dominating most of the wholesale energy trades), to $3.6 trillion in 2005.  Enron leads the field with double the online trading volume of its nearest competitor.

The accommodation will be in condominiums in Beaver Creek and room assignments are also attached below.

The videos will be seen prior to dinner on Friday night at Saddleridge. The video should be about  5 minutes in length, on a VHS tape and there is a zero budget assigned to the production of the video. Each team has been given a title which is open to interpretation (see attached spreadsheet).Please find attached the following information: (i) Attendees and Teams for Video (ii) Draft Agenda Any questions or concerns should be addressed to Dorie Hitchcock (Ext 36978) We look forward to seeing you in Beaver Creek.

The important thing is you need to get furniture as we currently have lots of rooms empty and they are refusing to give us furniture. The old building is a really bad idea due to the press etc - when it ends things will be easier.  But currently moral would be ahuge issue moving to the old building.

I am really getting worried on timing.  Could you guys get together and see if you can push forward on this today.  Try rining Dinerstien and explain the urgency.  I did mention to Hutchins and Costas that this is my main concern last week.  So we should involve Greg if you can't get anywhere. Thanks Louise

Let me know your thoughts and possibly we can discuss at this morning's meeting.  I will be participating by phone from the airport as I am on my way to Stamford.  As we move forward we have two huge tasks to complete at the same time, the integration with UBS Warburg and the re-start of our business.    The UBS corporate governance facilitates the creation of several committees which will meet on a regular basis to resolve issues and report on progress.  Within the UBS framework we will be creating a 'Transitional Steering Committee',  'Integration Committee' and 'Gas and Power Operating Committee'.  UBS has already created the Integration Committee which we will merge into.  Dave Forster will be attending all of these groups in the early weeks to ensure consistency and good communication.  Dave will also act as our point person for Mark Bridges from UBS, ensuring the simplest and most effective methods of communication are in place for both parties.This email outlines the governance structure that will be formalized with immediate effect:1.	Transitional Steering Committee:This committee will be responsible for the overall management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002.Committee Members:Mike Hutchins (co-chair)Greg Whalley (co-chair)Louise KitchenPat O'DonnellMike BolinProposed Logistics:This committee will meet on a weekly basis until shortly after the Launch Date, and then bi-monthly thereafter until December 31 2002.Minutes will be distributed to senior UBS and Enron management only.Proposed Time	- Wednesday 8:30am CST2.	Integration Committee:This committee will be responsible for the day-to-day management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002.  Any issues, which this committee cannot resolve, will be escalated to the Transitional Steering Committee.

Gas and Power Operating Committee:This committee will be responsible for the operational running of the Gas and Power Trading business.   The initial focus of this group will be the re-starting of the business. Following the relaunch the purpose of the Management Committees will be to push through its strategic plans and targets globally, to be able to react to market changes quickly, and provide a forum for communication across all locations.  These committees should also maintain, and develop further, any synergies between the Gas and Power Business and other UBS businesses.Proposed Committee Members:Louise Kitchen (co-chair)Greg Whalley (co-chair)Tim BeldenChris CalgerJohn LavoratoKevin PrestoHunter ShivelyRob MilnthorpPlus ad hoc members of the Logistical support functions as and when required.?Proposed Logistics:This committee will meet on a weekly basis but not before March 2002.Prior to March 2002, this committee will be replaced by two sub-committees - the Operational Re-start Sub-Committee and the Commercial Re-start Sub-Committee.3(i)		Operational Restart Sub-Committee This subcommittee will be responsible for ensuring that the support functinality is full available at the restart date.Proposed Sub-Committee Members:Louise Kitchen (co-chair)Pat O'Donnell (co-chair)Mike Bridges Sally Beck  - OperationsMark Haedicke - LegalWes Colwell - Financial OperationsBill Bradford - CreditDavid Port - Market RiskJay Webb - ITJenny Rub - InfrastructurePeter Keohane - CanadaDavid Forster - ubswenergy.com Proposed Logistics:This sub-committee will meet weekly until disbanded.Time Tuesday 8:00am CST3(ii)	Commercial Re-start Sub-Committee This subcommittee will be responsible for ensuring that the UBS Warburg Energy Counterparties are capable of transacting with our new company in the shortest time possible and in the most efficient way for both the counterparty and UBS Warburg Energy.Proposed Sub-Committee Members:Louise KitchenBryan Murtaugh - UBS LegalMark TaylorElizabeth Sager/Leslie HansenMary Cook/Jeff HodgeBill GlassBill BradfordPeter KeohaneBarry TycholizFrank VickersLaura LuceRob MilnthorpChris CalgerDavid ForsterOther members to be announcedProposed Logistics:This sub-committee will meet weekly until disbanded.Time Tuesday 10:00am CSTTammie will notify each of you of the rooms etc.

Everyone is still here and to be honest I'm proud of the fact they are holding on still to see if we can compete the sale.Here's a little fact - two years to the day of launch I turned EnronOnline off worldwide when it was in full swing, it was actually just when we had the downgrade announcement.  I think it will be back though.I think I am still in shock that a rogue finance group and some bad investments brought down a trading shop.

I have no idea who he is but please can we hire him back if/when we get EnronOnline back on top.  We need to remember him next year.A great reflection on you guys too.LouiseRef: Houston Chronicle website* * * * * Tuesday, Dec. 4 I was part of the greatest team I have ever seen or heard of. We had unmatched talent and skill. We had a seemingly bottomless pool of experience to draw upon. We consistently diplayed unyielding determination and unwavering resolve. But, above all, an unbreakable commitment to help make Enron Online great. Throughout the decline we did what we had always done -- we did our best. * * * * *  "Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office. ... They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too."  Matt Hommel,  former Enron employee * * * * * 	We have all read the news and we all know the things that happened at Enron and we all know the names of those to blame. At the end of it all, the truth is that bad things happen. For myself I humbly asked for only one thing: The chance to rebuild Enron Online. I waited all day praying that I would get a call to tell me that my wish had been granted. Around 9 p.m. I got the call from the senior director that I hoped was good news. In the utmost professional manner, I was informed that there was no good news. Now it's over. I still get a bit choked up when I think about it. I don't work at Enron, and the team that I was a part of has been scattered in the streets. I made some good friends at Enron, but I know I won't see many of them again. Enron took those friendships, Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office, they took the free sodas and the big screen TVs and the foosball table. They took away the free dinners we got on Friday nights during the new releases to the Web site. They took away the admin who always teased me because I ate like a pig and never gained weight. They took away the guy that beat me in foosball 5-1, despite the fact that he played with one hand and was carrying on a conversation on his cell phone while he played. They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too. But let me say this. I have my memories. I am not going to ruin them with feelings of resentment or betrayal. I am going to keep my memories. They belong to me.

Sorry.Anyway EnronOnline:  There are two versions today - we keep one in NewCo and the Estate keeps one.  Two teams can be allocated for each.It works - we have enough people to do it.In terms of the Estate:The Estate will keep a copy of the source code and the Estate will also maintain a staff on both the development side and the support side in order to ensure the service can be maintained.  The source code and build process are sufficient to allow for running almost immediately.  We actually have two EnronOnline environments today - the 'staging environment' and the real 'production environment'.  Essentially we would leave the staging environment for Enron - it is simply a question of staffing which I believe is totally possible now we have allocated the staff to NewCo and the Enron estate.In terms of NewCo:EnronOnline will be maintained for NewCo using the production environment.  With its own staff.

Enron had previously announced that the entiy would be 51% New Owner and 49% Enron.  We need to ensure this message is corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100% UBS owner. On the release for UBSWenergy.com - we do intend to trade physical gas and power immediately initially at least in the areas we can, so I have removed that sentence. Do you need all of the commercial  MD titles or is Kevin picked out for a particular reason?ThanksLouise

Suddenly a brand new Porsche screeches to a halt. The driver, aman dressed in an Armani suit, Cerutti shoes, Ray-Ban sunglasses, TAG-Heuerwrist-watch, and a Pierre Cardin tie gets out and asks the shepherd, "If I cantell you how many sheep you have, will you give me one of them?"The shepherd looks at the young man, then looks at the large flock of grazingsheep and replies, "Okay."The young man parks the car, connects his laptop to the mobile-fax, enters aNASA Webster, scans the ground using his GPS, opens a database and 60 Exceltables filled with logarithms and pivot tables, then prints out a 150-pagereport on his high-tech mini-printer. He turns to the shepherd and says,"You have exactly 1,586 sheep here."The shepherd answers,"That's correct, you can have your sheep."The young man takes an animal and puts it in the back of his Porsche. Theshepherd looks at him and asks,"If I guess your profession, will you return my animal to me?" The young mananswers, "Yes, why not?"The shepherd says, "You are an IT consultant.""How did you know?" asks the young man."Very simple," answers the shepherd."First, you came here without being called. Second, you charged me a fee to tellme something I already knew, and third, you don't understand anything about myfriggin' business. Now can I have my dog back?"

It is true to say that Netco is getting everything we have but we never had disaster recovery.  Netco is not getting additional equipment that the estate has to provide this function in the future either as it would mean the estate would lose functionality.In terms of our budget we only have a place holder for $10mm in the budget which Jenny assumes would cover equipment and licences but not facilities or ongoing costs.  Assumption is that we would take this year to get it in place and budget for next year.  We really are guessing too as we never had this facility before.  ThanksLouise

pat.odonnell@ubs.com,pat.odonnell@ubs.com,pat.odonnell@ubs.com,Subject: Proformas,PatFor your information, I have attached the current proformas (UBS and the standard).  I know John and Mike have had a lot of conversations on this - essentially where we stand is that the work has been done to complete the commercial reductions (by name) but the non-commercial groups have just been reduced across the board and we intend to start the process today on how to cut the numbers on the non-commercial side.  The theory was that communicating the Netcolite concept was something we would not do until we had a bit more clarity.  Webb knows but that's about it on the non-commercial side.Hope this helps.Louise  Louise KitchenChief Operating OfficerEnron AmericasTel:  713 853 3488Fax: 713 646 2308

Hopefully this will assist the meeting on Monday morning.Contracts StructureThere are three key documents that create the contractual environment for NetcoOnline: the 'Password Application' (PA), the 'Electronic Trading Agreement' (ETA) and the commodity contracts in the form of 'General Terms and Conditions' (GTCs) (or, alternatively, a Master Agreement). The PA is the only document which needs a written signature from the customer. The other documents are accepted online.PassWord Application (PA)The PA is a one-page document and is the only document that has to be physically signed by the counterparty (as opposed to any of the other documents, which are accepted online by clicking acceptance). The PA is the document by which the customer agrees to be bound by the terms of the ETA and the GTCs.  The PA, signed by an authorized person in the counterparty company, and approved by Netco, allows the customer to obtain a Master User ID. The Master User will be able to set up all traders and administrative users within his/her company and administer their access to various products in NetcoOnline. We will send copies of the PA to likely customers of NetCoOnline before we launch the site. The document will also be available to be printed from the website after we launch. Customers will specify their Initial Password in the PA and must change it in the first log-in session. Upon receipt of signed PA, Netco will under normal circumstances enable the Master User Passwords within 24 hours for pre-approved customers. For counterparties with whom we are not familiar, more time is needed to run credit, legal, contracts, regulatory and tax check.Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)The ETA binds counterparties to completed transactions through NetcoOnline. When the counterparty accesses NetcoOnline for the first time, he/she will be prompted to read and accept the ETA in order to proceed. The ETA states that all trades done via NetcoOnline will be governed by the General Terms and Conditions (GTCs) posted online for a particular product, unless there is a Master or any other Agreement between Netco and the counterparty in place.General Terms and Conditions (GTC)To be sent when the Buyer is known.When a customer offers to transact in a Product type for the first time, he/she will be presented with the relevant GTC. The GTC's are similar to a streamlined Master Agreement, in that they provide the general contractual framework for multiple transactions in a given commodity. GTC's identify termination rights, provisions for security (as appropriate), operational conventions (nominations, etc.), payment periods, tax treatments, force majeure, penalties for non-performance, etc. Customers must accept the terms of the relevant GTC online in order to proceed with a transaction, unless the company has a Master Agreement in place with Netco. Only one acceptance of GTC per Product Type per company is required. If there is a valid Master Agreement, then the system will not display the GTC, and the Master Agreement will apply.Password Application:   Electronic Trading Agreement:

In order to ensure that we start this process as quickly as possible we are looking to complete the filing documentation in advance of the bankruptcy decision on our future. Our current strategy is as follows (all dates are approximate) Present - January 10th, 2002        Complete filing documentationJanuary 11th                                Visit with FERC (One of senior executives here plus a senior executive from our buyer)January 13th                                 File and request an expedited process It would be extremelly helpful if you could identify someone for the Head of our Regulatory Group (Jim Steffes) to co-ordinate with at Citi.

Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise		These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.(iv)	Due Diligence	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.Happy New YearLouise

The ideal move time would be either this week-end or the next.  The idea is that everyone (856) resides on 5 and 6 in the new building.  HR has the most up to date list of who all of the people are.  But essentially the organisation is just a smaller version of what we have today.All commercial people on 6, non-commerical on 5.  We would need to plan for an office to be created in the room next to mine (but hold off on implementing that piece).As the credit group is already here (in the room next to mine) - it would be really good to move them first so they do not have to move back to the old building and then back.Thanks

Please check all expenses going back all year.This is a huge number which state they have been paid and have not hit my bank account.Of the expenses showing up not cleared on my bank account I have received none of the payments which I think adds up as follows:11/13/01	4,069:7211/10/01	21,010:1511/10/01	3,319:40Plus I have a cheque for a prior expense which bounced which is for about $4000.In pre- petition expenses this is clearly more than $5000.In post petition - I also have expenses pending which will bounce if the name on the payee does not correspond to the account holder name.Tammie - please work on this as our highest priority tomorrow.

I've been working on the upcoming meeting since March, but as you can imagine, the direction has changed several times.  We are delighted to have General Norman Schwarzkopf delivering a keynote address on leadership, and Gary Hamel returning to help us process the past year.  While we have arranged an all-star line up of outside speakers, we also want to focus on what is happening inside Enron.  Rather than having only one or two business presentations, Mark Frevert has opted to moderate a panel to provide a high level overview of each of our primary operating units and has selected each of you to participate.Currently, the panel is scheduled to take place 8:00-9:30am on Friday, November 16.  Please plan to present a very high level overview of your business.  You are welcome to use PowerPoint slides, but in the interest of time, presentations must be no more than 10 minutes.  Mark will introduce each of you, interject questions, encourage interaction, and ensure we stay on time. Below is the proposed order for your presentations.  Regardless of your place in the rundown, you will need to be seated on stage by 7:50am and equipped with a microphone.  Because we have a full agenda that morning, we will try to begin the session promptly at 8:00am.Stan Horton - Global ServicesLouise Kitchen - AmericasJohn Sherriff - EuropeMike McConnell - Global MarketsJeff McMahon - Industrial MarketsJanet Dietrich - RetailIf you elect to use a PowerPoint presentation, please forward it to me electronically by Friday, November 9 or provide the presentation to me on CD at the Management Conference.  To ensure consistancy, I've attached a PowerPoint template that I would like you to use.   Finally, Mark would like to meet with the six of you to finalize preparation for the panel at 4:00pm on Wednesday, November 14 following your arrival at the Management Conference.  The meeting will take place in the Library off the Main Lobby of the Westin La Cantera.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or need any assistance, please contact me.  I look forward to working with you.Regards,Terrie JamesSenior Director, Corporate Communication(ph) 713.853.7727(fax) 713.646.3248terrie.james@enron.com

A user of ibuyit can select whether they want new equipment or old equipment.  So I surveyed our assistants - obviously more than ours up here, to see if any of them knew that you could order OLD equipment instead of NEW.  None of them did, including TJ Black who has since I have been receiving my weekly reports ordered the most IT equipment.Jenny's group is to some extent relying upon this selection to buy the equipment.  Don Black's equipment was bought new even though he is about to move but will get used in remote offices where they have no flat panels.  So the buying is done by EA and someone else is benefitting.As there is no way around ibuyit, I think we need a default where we use old equipment instead of new equipment.As no-one replied to my previous email - I live in hope.ThanksLouise

If you have a problem with this - let me know.  I have to say finding someone to do this is a difficult job and all ideas welcome.  I think Beth brings a base understanding of the business and certainly should be able to drill down on IT side.

abigail.taylor@enron.com,abigail.taylor@enron.com,abigail.taylor@enron.com,Subject: From their web page,Why can't I consume alcohol on Atkins? You should not drink alcohol during Induction, but you can drink moderate amounts of alcohol during the Ongoing Weight Loss, Pre-maintenance and Maintenance phases of the Atkins Nutritional Approach. When given the choice, your body will burn alcohol for energy before it burns fat. But alcohol does not act as a carbohydrate so it will not interfere with burning fat in the same way that sugars and other carbohydrates do. Alcohol consumption may also increase yeast-related symptoms, such as bloating, gas and cravings for sweets, and can therefore interfere with weight loss. Beer, which contains yeast, probably has the most yeast-forming components of any alcohol. An occasional glass of wine or vodka is the best choice. Scotch and other grain-based spirits are more likely to promote yeast problems. Note: Use only mixers that contain no sugar or fruit juices. Even tonic water contains carbs and regular soda is made with sugar. Seltzer, club soda, mineral water and non-aspartame diet sodas are better alternatives.Louise KitchenChief Operating OfficerEnron AmericasTel:  713 853 3488Fax: 713 646 2308

Your ordering is very P&L based. Are we supposed to cover Wes or will Causey?  I added to your file schoolyard. Speak to you later.

Some areas are better than others but essentially, the overview is moving the wrong way (UP!).  We have no jurisdication over the Corp numbers.  As an aside, the technology budget is up dramatically from last year, the numbers coming from IT are huge ($735mm this year (excluding Europe) versus $600mm last year for the whole of Enron Corp).
