Who would you like for me to hand these over to?Duke/Centana Money wires will be complete on April 1. The proceeds from the transaction were received on Friday and the money that needs to be put into escrow will be sent out Monday, April 1. I have created a folder o:\gas structuring\centana duke, where I have put the files for the cash request forms, wire transfer forms and the mini- DASH. There is also a cashflow.xls that explains the calculations for the dollars. I also have a file on my desk. The commercial contact for Duke Field Services was Greg Swedinsky 713-627-6265. In order to finish the transaction, a decision needs to made with respect to the contract and a settlement on pre-petition dollars. Ponderosa Energy Partners I have been helping Rick Hill and Chuck Ward manage the supply for the Tenaska IV power plant. I have created a folder o:\gas structuring\tenaskaIV where I have put files relevant to the project. The file PPEP2.doc are some of my notes that I think will be helpful to whom ever takes it over. I  recommend Chris to help manage this, if that works for you.Pace Energy I have a letter from Pace that explains what actions they have taken. The dollar figures are less than $100,000. General Land Office. I have a file that contains a copy of the contract between GLO and ERAC and a copy of an internal deal sheet for the natural gas volumes.

ed.mcmichael@enron.com,ed.mcmichael@enron.com,ed.mcmichael@enron.com,Subject: DEC. MRT GAS,ENA had a term supply contract with Energen to purchase roughly 4,485MMBTU a day at 2.60 on MRT, which Energen terminated on December the 4th, 2001.  The operator for the supply, Duke Field Services, erroneously allowed  supply to continue to flow between Dec. 4-31. ENA also failed to remove its nomination for the supply, allowing it to continue to flow to ENA's market, Oneok.  Duke Field Services would like to get paid for the gas it delivered and has offer to sell ENA the gas at a price of 2.3375 (gas daily average for MRT West Leg). I have spoken with David Eubanks in gas settlements and he shows ENA receiving and delivering the gas to Oneok. I would like to try to get the MRT issue settled as soon as possible, for I feel that it would help facilitate the Centana Storage account (approximately $2,500,000 in positive cash flow). Although Duke recognizes that it has no offset rights for the two issues, they seem to be taking their time.

gregory.schockling@enron.com,gregory.schockling@enron.com,gregory.schockling@enron.com,Subject: ,The first detailed allegations that Enronabused mark-to-market accounting tohide wholesale trading losses haveemerged in congressional testimony pro-videdby a professor and former deriva-tivestrader who reviewed the Enron casefor Senate Governmental Affairs Com-mittee.Those charges, along with allega-tionsthat have surfaced that mark-to-marketaccounting was misused by EnronEnergy Services, the company's retailenergy and services unit, are expected tosupport the push by accounting rulemak-ersfor much more disclosure on mark-to-marketaccounting practices and theimpact of mark-to-market accounting onearnings trading firms' earnings.In testimony Thursday before theSenate Governmental Affairs Committeelast week, Frank Partnoy of the Universi-tyof San Diego Law School, said itappears that Enron traders mismarkedforward curves and manipulated theamount of profits and losses that wouldbe reported in financial statements."In a nutshell, it appears that someEnron employees used dummy accountsand rigged valuation methodologies to cre-atefalse profit-and-loss entries for the deriv-ativesEnron traded," said Partnoy, whoreviewed the case over several weeks at thecommittee's request. "It appears that Enrontraders selectively mismarked their forwardcurves, typically in order to hide losses.""Traders are compensated based ontheir profits," he observed, "so if a tradercan hide losses by mismarking forwardcurves, he or she is likely to receive alarger bonus."Partnoy said mismarking forwardcurves was not the only problem."For each trade," he testified, "atrader would report either a profit or loss,typically in spreadsheet format. Theseprofit-and-loss reports were designed toreflect economic reality. Frequently theydid not. Instead of recording the entireprofit for a trade in one column, sometraders reportedly split the profit from atrade into two columns. The first columnreflected the portion of the actual profitsthe trader intended to add to Enron's cur-rentfinancial statements. The second col-umn,ironically labeled the 'prudency'reserve, included the remainder."Partnoy told the committee that inhis estimation, "Enron's 'prudency'reserves did not depict economic reality,nor could they have been intended to doso. Instead, 'prudency' was a slush fundthat could be used to smooth out profitsand losses over time. The portion of prof-itsrecorded as 'prudency' could be usedto offset any future losses," he said.He recommended that investigatorsquestion Enron employees who wereinvolved in these transactions "to get a senseof whether my summaries are complete."Alleged Enron abuses of mark-to-market accounting emerge
