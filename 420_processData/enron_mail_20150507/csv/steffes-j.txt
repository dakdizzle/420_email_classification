angela.schwarz@enron.com,angela.schwarz@enron.com,angela.schwarz@enron.com,Subject: RE: Direct Access,Angela -The value proposition for a customer is related to which buckets of cost would be bypassed by switching to DA.  If a customer goes DA after August 24, 2001 (based on the discussion about surcharges in the legislation that has only passed the Assembly Energy Committee last night - with still a very low probability of success of being signed by the Governor), the customer would pay for SCE undercollection (PG&E isn't being discussed on this piece), DWR bond costs, and DWR net unavoidable.   The hardest piece to calculate - which Belden said on the last call he simply couldn't given the tremendous uncertainty - is the DWR net unavoidable.  If the customer has been DA since July 1, the customer could avoid the DWR net unavoidable (but the legislation could change or not pass and the CPUC could do something else).Each customer needs to appreciate this latest information and make a determination about what these amounts will be - the key question I'd ask a customer is that they need to try and keep their options open.Of course, all of this assumes that the CPUC doesn't go back and suspend DA even earlier than July 1 or something else crazy happens - remember this is California.Jim

Pretty hard line with Comm Wood.  I don't have any problems with it as written, but comments like "CYA not Calif Youth Admin" is not appropriate.2.    We don't deal with the requirement to submit contracts?  Should AReM address this?  My understanding is that for contracts with customers below 20kw we need to submit something (maybe with the price and term blacked-out)?  Is this correct?3.    In the conclusion, don't we want to ask the PUC to take some affirmative action - tell the industry that they will never implement retroactive suspension, that their is no cost shifting, and that DA customers can extend without penalty?  The filing simply asks for no harm.   Thanks,Jim

The EPSA paper indicates the preferred option of the 5 models that FERC Staff proposed.  Should EPSA at least indicate that it stands ready to analyze other solutions that may be proposed?  Gives EPSA an "out" of this recommendation if it proves later that FERC's application of the Delivered Price Test is unworkable.2.	 I don't understand when EPSA says "Our recommendation, therefore entails a more stringent method of assessing market power" on page 2 of the draft?  Why should EPSA indicate that it is comfortable with a 20% Economic Capacity test to FERC.  I would argue that 35% is the minimum we should entertain as an opening position.  Also, is there a fear that a power marketer would have to meet this test in "real-time"?  Having a once and done for three year application is ok, but if we are conditioned that we can't get beyond 20% in any market, what does this do to trading and how would this be reported?3.	  The discussion on Available Economic Capacity and its implication for having a "bias against new entry" is confusing.  Maybe we should clairfy our concerns.  4.	The argument that ALL new generation is by definition pro-competitive needs to be strengthened.  It should be explained in the context of the Delivered Price Test.  Also, it that still true if a party which holds 100 MW in a 500 MW market builds a 100 MW power plant - now 200 MW in a 500 MW market?  Maybe I am missing something.5.	EPSA needs to make the argument that Conditioning MBR on vague rules is wrong and anti-competitive earlier in the paper.  This is my biggest concern - that we are perpetually subject to some refund risk when the market "breaks" even though our fundamental presence has not changed.6.	I don't understand the EPSA paper on RTO versus non-RTO markets.  EPSA endorses something but I'm not sure what?  What does this mean if I sell on TVA's network?  I appreciate blanket authority, but I wonder about exactly how this would be constructed?  Would this be similar to the natural gas marketer blanket authority?  Also, doesn't this play into the hands of the transmission monopolists who don't want competition - if they never set up an RTO they never face competition?Jim

I fully agree on BF costs and DWR costs.  I believe that you are right on Est RT$ = CAISOM Imbalance, but I need to check.On the question of retroactive ratemaking, it is my understanding that you are correct.  PG&E probably won't rebill, but will need to put in place an adjustment to the going forward PX Credit to "collect" the overpayment of Negative CTC.All of this means that the impact of the FERC refund is less than 100c on the $ for the Negative CTC.Jim

I agree that if you were to go to a bottom's up, it would require the CPUC to put in place a surcharge for remaining stranded costs (non-generation, for example QFs) and a second surcharge for Negative CTC "overpayment".  Key question is who will pay the Negative CTC "overpayment"?  On trying to understand the PX Credit algorithim, my concern is that to understand how much the "overpayment" was during Oct - Feb, we need to understand how costs hit the structure during that time period.  Otherwise we don't know what form or amount of discount is required in the Settlement talks.Jim

Agree that offering Transmission Provider waiver given RTO status is premature.2.	Maybe strengthen argument that both unbundled Provider of Last Resort type service and bundled Utility sales service should be included in the affiliate definition.  At a minimum, in places like PA, where the Utility sales service is a direct competitor, there should be no difference with any competitive player.  In a state like GA, where the Utility sales service is a "monopoly" by statue (i.e., bundled retail), I still think given the ability to cogenerate, it makes sense to have these providers take transmission service similar to our service at wholesale.  Maybe make this argument earlier and as the core focus.  I fully agree to include these providers in the definition.3.	Leslie, call Christi N. to discuss examples of how Native Load Exemption has caused problems (we've put in earlier filings).4.	The question of "Holding Company, etc." -- We should argue for an exemption.5.	I am also troubled by the "administer" term.  FERC should prohibit any "helping" by the Transmission Provider of anyone in the marketplace.  Maybe focus FERC on clarifying its positions.6.	Emergency sections -- Keep the language you have that never applied to natural gas industry (and could be a real problem given a CAISO type situation - ask Alan Comnes for thoughts).  Probably don't object but want to make sure that if Emergency develops there must a pre-set timeframe for going back to normal business.7.	Everything filed at the FERC related to Standards of Conduct should be posted on the OASIS.I didn't understand the final bullet point comments.

The best split is probably just 50/50 on personnel.  While everyone is in a specific box on the org chart, many if not all of the people are flexible enough that they can cover different roles.  The $ on outside services may be able to be split differently going forward (for example, if EES wants something specific on a state PUC matter).2.	In terms of approving outside service expenditures, I would like to sit down with you, Louise, and Rick to work out what the best method of working through the approvals.  I will try and set up some time the first week of December.4.	I have put Steve Montovano in the NE Gas box.  This will increase the budget by $400k (based on historical figures).

Please don't take this as a signal that we can't continue to discuss and maybe help find a solution.Thanks,Jim=============================1) Profit-RTO - Where does your proposed organization fit in the attached graph in terms of end state ? Stage III? Stage IV? 2) Regarding document "Response of National Grid USA to questions posed by the Commission": Does it imply that core, for profit functions should not be subject to a stakeholder process? Wasn't the NETA design subject to an extensive consultation, even for profit, NG core functions?3) If each Transco manages it own OASIS, how can we avoid fragmentation (balkanization), pancaking and many othernegative aspects and seams that the RTO process is trying to eliminate? How can you achieve one-stop shopping? By outsourcing those functions to one single third party?4) As a follow up question, what are the mechanisms to assure that this "potential" fragmentation may lead to underinvestments in T, particularly in important inter-tie investments?5) What kind of PBR mechanism are you envisioning for the Transco-RTO? Are you thinking about including "external" measures such as cost to provide ancillary services, congestion costs or costs incurred in energy balancing?6) Are you envisioning an RTO-Transco model which will assume that all transmission assets in the region will be divested? Or can the model live with a "light" RTO where part of the assets are divested but others are not (and sign an operating agreement with the RTO. Would your proposed Matrix of RTO Functions (page 9) still be robust under this scenario?7) Can your proposed RTO model dovetail with an LMP/Congestion Management system based on financial rights? [Our understanding is that NETA completely reorganized the UK pool. The UK system now looks like a "self-dispatch" physical rights model] 8) As a follow up of the previous question: Assuming Alliance adopts a self-dispatch, physical rights approach similar to the one NG operates in the UK today. Don't you think that this will create significant barriers/seams with other neighboring RTOs, considering that there seems to be a general trend towards security constrained dispatch, LMP and financial rights for most RTOs in the US?9) If your proposed system can be dovetailed to a central dispatch, LMP/financial rights, shouldn't some functions in your "Martix of RTO Functions" be collapsed? For example: management of congestion prices, calculation of congestion, operations of energy markets and generation redispatch?10) Procurement and deployment of ancillary services is listed as non-core. However, in the UK system, this represents a significant role of the Transco, with incentives and penalties attached to its achievement. Is there a different vision or do you assume that those functions will end up being developed by the RTO and consequently will be part of the PBR formula?11) Generation interconnection. Obviously, your proposal did not go that far. Conceptually, do you favor a system whereby T fixed costs are recovered via a postage stamp rate across an entire region or do you favor the UK model whereby fixed costs (use of the system) are calculated based on incremental cost and have a strong locational component (and connection costs are treates separately, according to a shallow method?12) Establishment of transmission rates. How to reconcile the fact that those should be regulated and you propose that the Transco itself will establish its T rates? Are you thinking about some possible non-regulated activities?13) You stated that separation and control of T assets persists, to a large extent, in the Collaborative Model proposed as part of the Southeast Mediation. Do you think that the Independent System Administration model is superior in this regard? What are the key important differences in your view in the conceptual design of those models

I would change the message in the conclusion (and elsewhere) that the work should be done at the same time -- The Commission should act quickly to establish the scope and configurations of RTOs, WHILE ALSO WORKING and then begin the process of creating a standardized pro forma transmission tariff and market design to be implemented by these RTOs.  3.

Reportedly, some 30companies are awaiting similar reviews by FERC todetermine if the commission believes they exert marketpower. The 206 investigation reportedly also requirespower providers with market-based sales authority to amendtheir tariffs within 60 days to provide FERC withopen-ended authority to order refunds if the commissiondetermines that market manipulation has occurred.

We (meaning EES broadly) do have customers with metered demand greater than 1 MW (otherwise known as non-Price to Beat).2.	For non-Price to Beat customers that have not been DASRd or have no contract, the Affiliated REP will provide service to the customer beginning on their first meter reading after Jan 1, 2002 under a blanket Term of Service Agreement (let me know if you want copies) under the following price terms =TXU Energy Services cost = $5 per kw for Demand (based on highest demand in last 12 months) + $50/Mwh + $100/month + Delivery Costs + Taxes.  Reliant Energy Services cost = [1.5 * Daily Gas Index * kwh] + [{1.15 * Capacity Price} * kw (billing demand)] + $490/month + Delivery Costs + Taxes.3.	If the customer does not pay their bill, they will then be placed on POLR service.4.	The AREP offers month-to-month service with a 30 calendar day notice provision for cancellation.5.	Next opportunity to DASR these customers will be Dec 16, 2001.6.	When we find a buyer for the Texas book or all of the company, EES intends to obtain permission from the customer to assign the non-Price to Beat customers.  This implies that we will not be sending out the Opt-Out provision to non-Price to Beat customers.Jim

Having the key issues presented in one place was very helpful.To follow up on the meeting, the following are action items for the group.1.	December 1 Market Readiness Update MeetingThane Twiggs (wholesale) and Nancy Hetrick (retail) will have at this time an understanding of the billing and settlement issues (or not) with their respective areas.  We need to ensure that EES and EPMI are able to get the necessary information to make sure that their bills and settlements are working and that we can bill our retail customers.  I will ask Linda Noske to set up this meeting.  If anyone hears anything else about the market delay, please let Jean Ryall know immediately.  As of right now, it is my impression that we all agree there is no delay scheduled???2.	Congestion Pass thru to EES' Retail CustomersThane Twiggs, Nancy Hetrick and Jim Steffes will get with EWS and EES counter parties to try and work through the ability of EES passing thru congestion to its customers per the contract language.  I will lead the process of consulting with EES legal.3.	Wholesale Issues (Thane Twiggs)a.	Define workable TCR Product b.	End Balanced Schedule requirement c.	Fix Capacity Auction process, including credit mattersd.	BENA/OOM/ASe.	Settlement & Billing4.	Retail Issuesa.	REP - ISO - Utility Interface (Nancy Hetrick)b.	Reliant PTB (Pat Keene)c.	TXU PTB (Pat Keene)d.	Reliant Negative CTC (Pat Keene)e.	TXU Negative CTC (Pat Keene)f.	EES / EPMI License (Gloria Ogenyi + Nancy Hetrick)5.	Information FlowAll policy statements from anyone within Government Affairs should be first vetted with Jean Ryall to ensure consistency and conformity.  Also, all people on the TO: list above should be included on all e-mail traffic.  I know this may sometimes slow down response to business people, but I think that we can all agree that no one has all the information in this very fast moving environment and unless we have a central clearinghouse we may send the wrong messages.It is also critical that all commercial people interested in Texas need to hear about the latest.  By having Jean Ryall in the center, she will be able to ensure that no one feels "cut out".The bi-weekly meeting should be held with Jean Ryall as Host to follow these issues in a timely manner.  6.	Wholesale ProductsThane Twiggs was going to keep the team apprised of our products and pricing info on a regular basis so we are informed about the market.Finally, it is critical that everyone work together to get the best results possible for Enron in the Texas market.  This is our "home" base - we need to make sure that our business efforts win big.  Thanks for everything ya'll have been doing to achieve this result.Jim

I don't understand a 6 month collaborative to work through SMD - this only extends the implementation.2.	Need to push harder on doing away with the Reserve obligation.3.	I would argue that the RTO need not run a Day Ahead market.  Also, why does a Day Ahead market provide "sufficient capacity committed in the right places for the next day in order to supply load reliably"?  California has a DA market and people simply did not participate.  The argument that a DA market replaces a Unit Committment process doesn't seem complete?4.	The position and implications on CM and RT market going in at the same time needs to be made more clear - does this mean that Enron supports delaying all RTO "activity" (e.g., OASIS, single tariff, rates) until CM is complete?5.	What is a "point-to-point" financial hedge?  Does this imply node-to-node?  Can we include some discussion of market "hubs"?  How could I obtain a hub-to-node hedge?  Also, what about the allocation or auction process for FTRs?  How should existing transmission arrangements be managed?6.	Do we agree to Incremental pricing vs. Rolled-In?  Will this cause any heartburn for ETS?  What about the cost of expansion to meet the needs of incremental generation?  Should this be borne by the system or the generator?My thought is that this is a big piece and Enron should probably file its own comments rather than sign on.  Sarah Novosel is working on Enron comments.Jim

richard.shapiro@enron.com,richard.shapiro@enron.com,richard.shapiro@enron.com,Subject: Issues in IL,1.	Dynegy vs. ComEd at FERCDynegy filed a complaint at FERC that tries to disallow Firm LD from being used by marketers under the ComEd Network Service.  IP claims that is losing $ MM because customers are not paying for Capacity.  This will impact our ability to "go physical" starting next year.2.	MISO vs. ARTOIP is a member of the ARTO.  EPMI continues to try and establish only one RTO in the region.  I think this is why Dynegy won't state very clearly that 4 RTOs makes sense.  No $ impact, although this decision may impact our ability to "go physical" starting next year in Illinois.3.	CTC Bet in ComEdMy recollection (talking with Harry K.) is that we pre-sold a CTC roll-off in ComEd that could cost our business around $10 MM if it doesn't happen.  Most talk in Illinois is that CTC should end early for big customers, so not sure if this is an issue.4.	Delivery Service Tariff LitigationComEd and IP have filed to increase their rates on Delivery Service Tariffs (but not on Bundled customers because there is a statutory rate cap).  EES told us originally that this could cost as much as $50MM, but current estimates are closer to $10MM for ComEd and $2MM for IP.5.	PPO (Power Purchase Option) TerminationComEd is pushing to end the PPO service.  PPO provides a re-sell service to marketers while sharing the Mitigation Factor with customers.  It is the service we use to "deliver" today in ComEd.  IP will probably terminate this service because their stranded costs are expected to end sooner, hence, not a major issue for IP?6.	Relative Size of Current EES BookComEd	=	7.8 MM Mwh (extends through 2010)IP	=	1.3 MM Mwh (extends through 2008)Hope this helps.  Data will improve with more time.Jim

I agree that making arguments about merchant generation "stranded costs" is questionable, better to couch this as "structural impact on market participants".  More importantly, if I bought 50% of generation in one market, and FERC changes their rules, seems like I either (a) sell generation and take the loss or (b) get regulatory risk insurance.  FERC has the right to make markets work.Finally, on the issue of blanket authority, I think that the CAISO model is a good example of why this may not work for Enron.  In the long-run, as a market-maker, Enron needs workable markets.  A good test case would have been this - under FERC's proposed rules, would FERC have granted market-wide waiver in California?  If FERC is comfortable with the result, than move ahead.Thanks,Jim

Karen Denne with PR is getting quite a few phone calls from California media sources.The strategy has to be to downplay Enron and have the customer pitch "their pain" by this action of the CPUC.

I have asked Gloria Ogenyi to lead this effort for us.  We will need other groups to appoint a Lead for their teams as soon as possible (I will work with Evan, Legal, and Product Development to find out the appropriate people).I fully concur with Rogers that within all new Product Development activities there must be a clear analysis of our obligations and appropriate resource allocation to continue supporting the market activity.   As important, just because we don't want to attract new business in a given market doesn't mean that our responsibilities have ended.  We need to ensure that our Product Development activities are accounting for the costs of these obligations over the long-term.  To ensure that we are selling in accordance with applicable regulations, I would recommend that Gloria be on the Product Development sign-off sheet.In addition, we have already begun reviewing obligations, etc. for our current market activity (both wholesale and retail).  I will talk with Gloria to build the matrix of issues you referenced.  Our goal is to make current all of our market obligations.I will call you to provide an update on the market review when I have more information.  If you want to talk about this, please call.Thanks,JimPS - I'll ask Gloria to give you an update on the IL bonding status.

In Enron's advocacy throughout my years, we have always asked the PUCs to make the marketer the "customer of record" - better limits the Utility control over the market.  Now it appears that this good decision of the PUCT has tax implications and means that we have to process the taxes.  I don't see that trying to support a change is a good thing from our long-run business.   Moreover, if we are paying Gross Receipts taxes and didn't include them into our customer costs than we made a mistake.  This is a cost of our business.  Let's talk.Jim

My basic model for provisioning of energy for retail competition in non-ERCOT Texas is that delivery to the border of the OATT provider (for instance delivering a into-Entergy product into Arkansas and paying for losses would be sufficient for delivery into the Woodlands).Jean was going to call Luiz to get this issue on the burner.

Some things to be aware of --1.	EES/EEMC v. SCE ComplaintWe filed Aug 30 before the CPUC asking the CPUC to re-instate our customer net bill amounts.  Jeff Dasovich will call John Fielder to try and see if there is anything that we can do without litigating the case (or at least delay until after legislative session).  If complaint moves forward, SCE will probably consolidate the complaint with earlier disputes.  Enron is preparing similar filing for PG&E, although we need to seek Relief from the Stay.  2.	California LegislationSCE MOU bill (that includes DA issues) moved Aug 29 through Assembly Energy Committee.  Needs to go to Assembly Appropriation and full Assembly.  Hertzberg is trying to get out by weekend or early next week.  By removing the conservation easements, the bill has lost some liberal Democrats.  Governor Davis is asking Business to find 15+ Republicans to move the bill.  Trying to modify (1) surcharge effective date to Sept 1+ and (2) get more comfort that SCE will pay our Negative CTC if $$ exists.Also, the Windfall Profits bill has moved through Assembly Committee.  It has to go through Assembly Appropriation and full Assembly.  Jennifer Thome has prepared a synopsis that is attached. 3.	AG Subpeona / Sen Dunn SubpeonaLitigation about both Subpeonas was heard this week in SF and Sacramento.  Mike Kirby believes that he may have swayed the Court in the Sen Dunn to provide a protective order.  A final decision may be issued next week.4.	FERC Refund CaseEnron presented its "ripple" claim earlier this week.  Range of refunds (non-netted) is very large (please see Bob Frank for exact $$).  I have also attached a calendar of both cases prepared by Alan Comnes.  Oral testimony is being prepared in PNW case for next week. 5.	NE RTO Mediation / SE RTO MediationBoth proceedings come to a close this week with an expectation that the ALJ issues a recommendation next week (or soon thereafter).  Looks like the best date that a large number of parties can agree to for a single NE RTO energy market is Nov 03 (PJM thinks it can happen by May 03 but wants some cushion).  Sarah Novosel is trying to best position us vis-a-vis the other stakeholders to drive it earlier.  Also, ICAP and control area consolidation is not considered at this time.  Christi Nicolay believes that the ALJ will recommend moving toward a PJM model.6.	CPUC Decision to Suspend DA RetroactiveSue Mara continues to push the CPUC to remove the retroactive date in the current Proposed Decision.  Some rumors that the CPUC will again delay a decision until Sept 13 (confirming so please keep close).

All they will do is reset prices.  The Utilities and the CPUC will then have to decide the legality and the equity of modifying the PX Credit and hence the Negative CTC.  We have tried in the CA Refund process to highlight the fact that much of the "high" prices were due to inappropriate policy and actions of the CPUC, Governor, and Utilities.  The core problem with this line of argument is that the Refund process didn't ask the first question - what or who is to blame.  It simply took dysfunction and ran.  We are trying in the context of the Rehearing case to ask FERC to restart with the right question.  Also, remember that we aren't going to have a solution in the FERC case until sometime next year, probably after SCE gets its money.  Finally, I think that the right policy decision is not to "re-bill" Negative CTC but rather to prospectively recover the costs.On point #2 - See point above.  I doubt, however, that all "high" prices can be seen as just a result of underscheduling.Jim

They are simple wrong.  Unless and until we get all of our "positive" CTC back from the Utility, why should I even begin to consider their "goofy" arguments.  In addition, SCE is receiving $3.3 B which is a full payment of all Negative CTC.  If their issue is to have a Undercollection charge against all customers, that's a different policy matter.  The CPUC agreed to the idea of Negative CTC and SCE needs to pay.  Also, if we are 5% of load and the Undercollection is $3.3 B, I think that SCE would be looking for $165 MM - our entire claim.

Sue Mara is leading the effort to respond to the CPUC for Enron.2.	We knew that the CPUC was at a minimum going to investigate how and/or whether to allow extensions of contracts and the application of other surcharge $$ to DA load given their earlier statements.  The issue on retroactivity is open primarily because they can ask these questions and (I believe) as leverage for other issues.3.	We are coordinating with the big customers who recently left.  They are marshalling forces to oppose any retroactivity.  This is as much their fight as it is ours.4.	At this time, Enron will file as a member of AReM.  We intend to oppose the CPUC's request for our contracts and transaction information.If you want any other info or want to discuss further, let me know.Jim

All of this assumes that we should be able to migrate to a more physical model if the industry needs to later.I do think that it would be helpful for you to get together and work up a discussion for all Government Affairs to explain the key differences and what policy discussions we need to focus upon - (i.e., setting up good "hubs" and auctioning transmission rights).Also, I think that any thoughts you have on the implications for EES are important.  Not sure that either model is really "great" for competitive retailers.  The difficulty is that our predictions of load and the actual usage will always be different.  As long as (1) our analytics have the data to "price" basis between hubs and from a hub to a customer and (2) there is no discrimination in allocation of transmission rights then our ability to sell at retail will be competitive.Jim

Focus more on Tariff standardization (I think that this is the key issue for Enron because LMP based bid balancing market is almost a done deal - and the Texas market seems to be fine for liquidity).  Build around a new proforma with a NETWORK PLUS model.2.	I would highlight that size matters - re-double our arguments and documents on natural markets in this filing as attachments.3.	I would highlight the importance of ending the control area benefits and also strengthen the arguments for no source/sink requirement.4.	The gas / power industries are different not because the amount of vertical integration (ie, CNG) but because of the geographic reach.  Many LDCs used Columbia p/l, but only one LDC uses AEPs.  The electric market needs transmission to be "rationalized" across the marketplace so moving power to where it's needed from where it's at.5.	Should we attack the 209 Boards?

In addition, we have not identified where the "credits" are if they are not on the customer's accounts.  My recommendation is to first (a) work with SCE - have Jeff Dasovich run the traps and (b) discuss the issue with CPUC Division of Energy and see if there is a solution without Complaint. If this doesn't get us anywhere before August 19, then it seems that to protect our interest we would need to file a complaint with the CPUC.  I am not opposed to LeBouef looking into federal action, but that seems a bit dramatic without first trying to exhaust our adminstrative remedies.Please call me.JimP.S.

Maybe we should (as a team) call Transelect (Paul Buckman) before our NG meeting.  You may remember that Transelect sent an initial letter into Skilling to try and solicit our support for stopping the NG application to be managing member of the ARTO.  I think that it would be good to call Buckman and ask if he has a better idea than NG.  We are right now stuck between two very bad answers - let AEP and FE construct a managing member or have NG.  Maybe Transelect has a better solution.2.	Chief Issues with NG --a.	are they "really" independent?  having a short position in NY and owning generation in NE effectively makes NG into a "market participant" - I think that Enron should make as a hold firm position that to operate an RTO there can be no agreement with anything less than almost perfect independence.b.	who do they feel the customer is?  maybe we want to get Paul Dawson's take on their business model from the UK.  it is critical that the new RTO operators across the country view traders/marketers and generators as their key customers.  what form of regulation for cost recovery of their operating expenses do they want - pass thru, PBR, etc.? c.	who writes the tariff?  I would make a strong argument that the problem with most of the RTO work to date has been that FERC has allowed the current incumbents to first write a bad tariff and then assign the provision of service under that tariff to someone who has very little (if any) control over future changes.  the RTO operator must be free to make changes to the tariff with only two constraints - (1) must not restrict the ability to pay facility revenue reqts and (2) must not damage the assets.  d.	do they intend to build/own transmission and how does this impact the energy markets?  will their planning and construction processes impact any long term positions that EPMI may take in the energy market.  how do they manage to allow other merchant transmission into the business?e.	how do they intend to provide balancing energy?  the flip side of our fight on congestion management involves the pricing of energy imbalances.  what is NG intending to do on this issue?  does NG believe that multiple control areas makes sense for a single RTO?  does NG support unbalanced/uncovered schedules day-ahead?  Also, just to let people know, Kerry Stroup will also be working on the Midwest RTO efforts going forward.  Please keep him included on the e-mails.Jim

We can release (very quietly) to influential persons Wal-Mart, Raytheon, and Northrop.It is also critical that we try and contact someone from Boeing to get their read of the bill and its impact.

Your model now assumes a modification to the Distribution tariff to include a new rate element.  That may get around the Settlement (although OCA in PA will think that now D is going up and there is no offset in the G rate so consumers are getting screwed because they won't switch).  Also, can the PaPUC implement this charge and direct the EDCs to transfer the funds to third-party generators?  Seems like that would require legislative changes.  I like the idea that there should be fixed charge for ICAP - one way to get that number would be to go back to the EDC stranded cost cases and look at their filed testimony - remember if they are earning more from the market than that $ amount, they are overearning on their stranded costs.Jim

The data is due at FERC no later than Thursday August 16.The key strategic issues in submitting the data to the ALJ include the following --1.	Do we exclude bookouts (ie, only physical transactions)?It appears that other market participants intend to exclude bookouts.  EPMI should also exclude bookouts given that these transactions never went physical and hence are not appropriate to consider in this case.2.	Do we provide only sales transactions or do we include our purchases?The ALJ's Order allows parties to include purchases only if the selling party is not an intervenor in this case and hence, our purchase would not be included in the data.  The ALJ wants to limit the amount of data to be provided to ease the workload.  Our initial analysis of some data from other parties is that there will be transaction data irregularities and hence, we should provide all of our relevant sales and purchases.  By having the data in the case, we can dispute any inappropriate transaction and ensure that all of our purchases are included in the calculation of refunds.  This is key for Enron in that our primary defense is that Enron deserves refunds as a purchaser to offset any sales refund amount.3.	Do we provide data for all 4 time blocks (through 24 hours, through 7 days, through one month, through 1 year)?The ALJ's Order indicates that parties are to provide data for transactions that are not consistent with the initial definition of "spot" - deals less than 24 hours done day ahead or day of.  Our initial recommendation is to provide the data but to retain our arguments that this is not consistent with FERC's Order.  The primary downside of not complying with this element of the data submission request is that we anger the ALJ and end up providing the data anyway after being told directly to comply.  In addition, it is possible that by providing all of the data we could be creating the problem that some economist or competitor could get their hands on the data at a later date and "determine" our trading strategies.  Weighing these risks, I would still recommend to include this data but argue before the ALJ and the FERC the ultimate relevance.4.	Do we provide data based on contract date? The ALJ has requested data for contracts that were valid on December 25, 2000 that had physical energy flowing after December 25, 2000 through June 20, 2001.  This would explicitly include Balance of the Month transactions for December 2000 and the associated physical flows. To minimize the hours on these transactions, we intend to enter the transaction date in the data submission to allow for FERC staff to delete inappropriate transactions.I will call you this morning.

steve.swain@enron.com,steve.swain@enron.com,steve.swain@enron.com,Subject: RE: ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE -- Calif analysis,Steve -- Thanks.  Looks good.  Some thoughts for you to consider: 1.    Not sure that Impact #1 makes sense to present.  No real reason to set CTC = 0 c/kwh on Jan 5 (CalPX was still in operation).  I think that Impact #2 better captures the idea.  Also, probably not good to use the term "CTC Eliminated".  Maybe should say "CTC = 0 c/kwh".  Given the CPUC's March 27 Order, the Utilities have a claim for additional generation related stranded costs until March 31, 2002. 2.     In calculating Impact #2, what did you use as the Jan 19 - Aug baseline?  Did you calculate the hit of ($104.5) from actual bills or based on our DJ Index model (there is a fundamental difference in likelihood based on the baseline)?  Also, I assume that the Feb - Aug timeframe was relatively low because EES and EEMC had most of their load on bundled service. 3.    Probably should discuss in a footnote the different models for PX Credit calculation and most specifically the PG&E Adjustment.  Also, may be interesting to have the $ impact of the PG&E Adjustment (the rate adjustment to re-capture their previous mistake).  I think that this is something we need to go into the CPUC to fight pretty quickly. 4.    Should Impact #4 and Impact #5 apply to SCE's loads?  In column 4 it looks like it does.  SCE is not currently hitting our bills with this surcharge. 5.    Probably better to model Impact #5 as of Oct 1 not Sept 1. 6.    Can you break out the volumes for "vintage" contracts versus "retail gen with passthru" contracts?  You haven't shown anything for (a) Utility Undercollection costs or (b) CDWR bond fees.  These costs may hit our vintage contracts. Jim

As you aware, after returning our customers to DA recently, our billing department was expecting that the past Negative CTCs would be returned to our customer's accounts - this has not happened nor after conversations with SCE will it occur.  This complaint is the next step in the process of attempting to recoup these funds.  Primarily EES does not want to pay for Utility charges for our customers while an outstanding Negative CTC balance is due.One key risk with filing this Complaint is that SCE may consolidate this case with the earlier Complaint that is currently on hold.  Probably not too big of a downside.We will be paying the bills into the CPUC for holding until the resolution of the Complaint.Any questions or issues please let me know.Jim

While I am always supportive of more public statements pushing competition, neither I nor Enron can sign on to the letter.  First, I am concerned that having Enron sign on will distract from your messages.  Enron is a "hot button" in DC and will change the proper focus.In addition, I would argue that the recommendation for a national commission is out of place with the current timing of FERC and Congressional action -- which is imminent -- while a commission would delay action on the Hill and at FERC, thus supporting the forces against competition.  Let's not study this too much - we know what to do.  Move away from the commission.Also, I'm not sure how providing federal grant money only to states that promote competition supports our efforts.  Making GA pay for PA is a distraction from the main fights at FERC and on the Hill.Finally, I would guess that more funds to FERC and other agencies will only be used to increase enforcement against those in the industry.  While Enron wants markets that work well, the core problem is that we haven't deregulated enough - not that markets aren't working. Also, I don't know where the recommendation numbers from the Bush/Cheney plan came from -- I think it was an earlier document -- there are no such numbers in the final printed version of the report that I have.If you want to talk, please let me know.Thanks,Jim

A couple of discussion points.    I am still not so much in love the LMP as this paper makes it seem you are (I don't believe there is a perfect solution).  Also, the document is not consistent relating to Control Area consolidation.  For instance, the issue around CA or RTO with tagging makes no sense if there is only one CA - the RTO.  This is important to highlight to the ALJ.  The easiest way to solve the problem is to do away with the archaic systems of the old world.  Also, I still don't fully understand why we are happy that the SAC gets to pick the IMA.  I personally despise the concept of a SAC - never has worked when times get tough.  Also, no real discussion (or maybe I missed) of timing to implement - next phase?Anyway, great work in the mediation.  Keep pushing these guys from the South.  Thanks,Jim

How does NERC define "security"? (important to differentiate between national security and system security).2.	What is NERC's role in national security?3.	Will RTOs degrade national security?  system security?4.	What does Enron think about calls to restrict access to network information such as transmission maps?5.	Does Enron oppose additional emphasis on securing electricity infrastructure?This Q&A should not be released to the public.  I think this is just to make sure that all of Govt Affairs is on the same page and our DC team has good answers to hard questions.Thanks.

My understanding is that AEP in Texas is wholly outside of ERCOT (if wrong - please inform).  AEP needs only to file a good amendment to the FERC OATT (or SPP needs to do it for them) ASAP.  My basic model for provisioning of energy for retail competition in non-ERCOT Texas is that delivery to the border of the OATT provider (for instance delivering a into-Entergy product into Arkansas and paying for losses would be sufficient for delivery into the Woodlands).Jean was going to call Luiz to get this issue on the burner.Thanks

In addition, the paper= states that "MUCH OF THE BLAME FOR CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRICITY CRISIS ATTACHE=S TO THE STATE'S RESTRUCTURING PLAN -- BUT NOT TO ITS OBJECTIVE, ELECTRICIT=Y DEREGULATION."In addition, California's response of "DIRECTLY INTERVENING IN THE MARKET -=- A RESPONSE THAT COULD PROVE COSTLY TO ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS AND TAXPAYERS=."I hope that we can use this to persuade FERC that they are missing the boat= on the Refund case.  The CBO has now stated publicly that the fundamental =market conditions and the State's poor plan and actions created the financi=al and political crisis.
