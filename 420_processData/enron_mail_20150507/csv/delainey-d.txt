I don't think I disagree with any of the points you made and I do think we have come a long way over the last year in the DSM "technology" we employ.

It is my opinion that we should be trying t=o "un-buckle" these companies from Enron over the short term to ensure thei=r continued viablility as we find a sale.  In my view un-buckling means a) =stop the factoring of any Construction Services receivables that end up mov=ing cash out of Construction Services up into the parents; b) utilizing tho=se receivables plus, if necessary, Enron's interest in Construction Service=s to obtain sufficient collateral to renew the St. Paul surety bond.  This =surety bond is necessary to continue contracting; and c) terminate the swee=ping of cash from Construction Services bank accounts to Corp immediately. = There will be a meeting early next week with St Paul to renew the surety b=ond.  I am hopeful that meeting these conditions will be enough to reinstat=e the surety bond.  The Construction Services group employs approximately 2=,600 people and is worth (given current backlog) between $100 and $125 mill=ion dollars.  Mark and his team are actively trying to sell over the next 6=0 to 90 days and we control 100% of the stock of this company.The other part half of the former EFS is the Facility Services group (also =know as ServiceCo). Again, these companies largely operate independently of= Enron and have going concern value outside of Enron.  Currently, we have o=utside technology and financial partners in the Facility Services Groups th=at make it impossible to factor receivables or move cash out of Facility Se=rvices bank accounts without the approval of the board which includes sever=al outside directors.  We currently own approximately 85% of the firm that =employs approximately 1,400 people and is worth minimum $50 million dollars= (cash value).  Mark and his team are actively trying to sell or otherwise =dispose over the next 60 to 90 days.EES also manages several joint ventures (DSM and O&M related mostly) with c=ustomers where we would have to have outside approvals to move cash out of =these entities. These include Owens Corning Energy LLC (Owens Corning), LE =Hesten Energy LLC (Lily), Tenant Services Inc. (Simon Properties), EBC Prop=erty LLC and Enron Distributed Energy Services LLC.  In all cases, we need =to be observant of corporate governance issues with these entities.As officers, I thought it prudent to ensure that you and your team had all =available information.  I would also like your approval to move forward wit=h my recommendations for the Construction Services group as above.We appreciate everything you are doing.RegardsDave Delainey

At this point, we have approval to pay up to $5K immediately and possibly up to $15K per pre-petition expense statement. This part of the bankruptcy process.  It is actually harder to get pre-petition expenses paid than post-petition.Unless I have my facts wrong, you should have been paid already or are in the queue.Either Kalen or Dan will follow up.
