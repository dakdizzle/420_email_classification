The Dynegy folks took me to New York for the analyst prsentations and made a big deal about Enron's pipelines and about me coming over.  The only problem is they never asked me if I was planning on going over.  I know their CEO and COO very well so I will probably have a choice.  I would like to see this thing through.  I committed in my current contract to stay until 3/1/05 so I would like to keep my commitment even though the options they gave me sign the contract are worthless.  I do feel an obligation to help right the ship.  My businesses keep performing well and are anchoring the ship right now.  Employees are pretty scared so having some key executives stand up and commit to stay is pretty critical.  Either way I will be fine.  Thanks for your concern.  It means alot.Stan

At thesame time FERC's approval of the effort by the 9 NW utilities (IOUs plus BPA)to form RTO West was conditioned on making a 12/1/01 compliance filing thataddresses seams issues with California and Canada, and a timetable forcreating a West-wide RTO. Together, these orders should help preventCalifornia's efforts to balkanize their power system.4)FERC's order on RTO West gave a boost to the inclusion within the RTO of theindependent-for-profit transmission company (TransConnect) proposed by 6 ofthe 9 RTO utilities including PGE. Relying heavily on TransConnect'sindependence, the Commission approved TransConnect's proposal to file forinnovative and incentive rates.5)Wholesale sales continue strong in a robust market.6)Thermal plants are in sequential annual  maintenance outages.7)Hydro plants operations are reduced due to poor water condition in NW.8)Contract negotiations continue with IBEW Local 125.

I can assure you that at times I too feel that I do not know everything that is going and that is probably correct.  I can tell you that Jeff McMahon did receive the offer from the Royal Bank of Scotland at or around RAB.  I have supplied him the potential financial impact of Enron accepting that offer.  As of yesterday no decision had been made about responding to their offer.  I suspect that a decision should be made early next week.  I would appreciate your thoughts as soon as you can supply them to me.Ken Lay and Dynegy have both characterised Enron's investments in water assets as non-core which means of cource that they will be divested in due time.  I would think that that would be the final straw that triggers the goodwill impairment.  We all recommended that if Enron could not support the goodwill remaining on the books then we should proceed with trying to sell Wessex at or around RAB.  That is where we are right now.  Again, please send me your comments.  I would try to keep this confidential since we have not yet made a descision.  I am sorry if I have not done a good job of communicating with you the past few weeks.  Things are quite hectic as you can imagine.

Aura.     -  Received revised bid from UBS which Metts describes as "real."  UBSwill now commence detailed 6-8 week due diligence on EWC (at Enron'sexpense if deal busts).  Confidence re: UBS' ability to execute remainsmixed.     -  LJM (Fastow) interest continues, but unclear how parallel processcan be run.  Umanoff concerned about conflict when management assistsseller as part of UBS deal but assists buyer as part of LJM deal.     -  Now that '01 numbers scrubbed, in process of revising '02 financialprojections based on detailed internal review (as of December, 2000, '02EBITDA projected at approximately $115mm; up from 1CE '01 projection of$78mm). This is unrealistic; I expect 2002 EBITDA in the $90-95mm range,showing solid 15-20% EBITDA growth.2.  M&A Activity.     -  acquisition of assets of bankrupt Dutch blade manufacturer, Aerpac,continues; we have closed on several assets and expect final closing inMay.     -  sale of Greek operating projects to German buyer continues, butexecution uncertain.  Closing targeted for June 30.  Sale of Greekdevelopment company also launched, with 2 parties expressing interest.3.  2001 Commercial Activity.     -  US backlog remains firm.  Projected demand continues to exceed ourprojected turbine supply.  Key execution issue is confimation ofsuitability of 1.5 MW turbine (primarily its gearbox) in more rigorous USwind regimes.     -  American Electric Power has provided indicative bid to purchase thetwo Texas projects we have under development (Indian Mesa I and Clear Sky);indicative bid price is attractive.  AEP has requested Enron Corp guarantyof EWC's turbine warranty, like they have received on previous sales withEWC.  Enron Corp guaranty is approved internally, but, in light of Aura,we will continue to bargain for no Enron Corp credit support. Finally, debtfinancing expected to close on IMI in May and debt circled on Clear Sky inJune.  Turbine suitability due diligence is key pacing item for debtclosing.     -  European backlog remains firm, expect for Spanish sales of 750kwturbine, which remains soft. EWC attended Hannover Fair last week, thelargest industrial trade show in Europe.  Our exhibit was very wellreceived.  CEO of German competitor, Enercon, approached Umanoff to discussIP issues (Enercon is currently barred from US market on patentinfringement grounds).4.  HR Issues.     -  US has lost O&M director and 2 key commercial employees haveexpressed concerns.  Need to finalize retention program (Umanoff to discusswith Horton early in week).     -  Key recruiting initiatives are: GM Spain; head of globalprocurement/blade MFG; European GC.  Umanoff would also like to re-visithiring US GM/MD, as day-to-day US operations require more detailedoversight than Umanoff is currently providing; not clear if we can recruitfor this position in the midst of Aura.Stan - for the future, please let me know whether this is the right levelof focus.  Talk with you soon. Adam

mariella.mahan@enron.com,mariella.mahan@enron.com,mariella.mahan@enron.com,Subject: Eco Progress,X-FileName: SHORTON (Non-Privileged).pstI think this is a good summary of where we are:1.  QF Status:  Mirant is willing to provide a legal opinion that it meets the QF status under the PPA if it is required to close.2.  A market report should be issued by Mirant today as to the reasons they have only been able to secure $300 million instead of $500 million in insurance.  Hopefully this will satisfy the lenders.3.  Mirant's proposal went out today on how to protect the lenders if the SHO is extinguished.4.  Mirant and GE have agreed to a closing checklist and fee coverage.Things left to do:1Finalize all documents2.  Receive underwriter approval on the resolution of all insurance claims.3.Agree upon mirror guarantees with Enron and Mission relating to the Union Carbide guarantees.Jeff Donahue informs me that CFSB feels secure that this deal will close on December 15 but not before.  The reason is that there are PPA bids that need to go out by that date.Let's keep daily status reports coming. If I have misrepresented anything in the summary, please let me know.
