I will be faxing to you this afternoon the existing Contract's that I have marked through with the changes.  A brief summary is as follows:	The Buy / Sell Contract is where Cannon Interest Houston delivers gas to HPL June - October and receives gas from HPL November - February.	The purchase price June - October is Houston Ship Channel Index.  The sales price November - February is the June - October Houston Ship Channel 	WACOG plus $.21.  The Term currently goes through February, 2005.  Cannon Interest Houston has proposed that the term be extended through 		February, 2011 and that the sales price November - February of each year be the June - October Houston Ship Channel Index plus $.17.	The Bammel Storage Contract currently has a term through February 28, 2005.  Cannon Interest Houston would like to extend the term through February 	28, 2011 at a Storage fee of $400,000 per year.  The individual at Cannon Interest Houston that you need to call if you have any questions is Patrick Locke.  His telephone number is 713-706-4318.  If you have trouble reaching him it may be easier to call his cell phone which is 713-817-5388.  I would appreciate it if you would call so we can discuss once you have had time to review.  713-853-7705	Jim Schwieger

I have lost all respect for Enron Senior Management a=nd agree with the Financial Analyst when they say that Enron Senior Managem=ent can not be trusted.  Ethics and Morals are either something everyone el=se needs to have except Senior Management or somewhere along the way Senior= Management started believing the end justifies the means.  The communicati=on the Employee's have received over the last few years about values such a=s Respect, Integrity, Communication and excellence must be propaganda inten=ded to get Employee's to believe Senior Management really supported these v=alues so that no one would really notice that their actions represented som=ething just the opposite.I can not believe that Senior Management lacks the understanding of human n=ature to totally ignore the fact that if someone does not trust what you ha=ve said in the past you should not try and conceal pertinent information in= the future.  Then to allow an Enron Spokesperson to speak for Enron with t=he statement "It's just a balance-sheet issue"  implies to me that this ind=ividual does not know what a Balance Sheet or Income Statement is and certa=inly should not be speaking to the public.  If you are going to play the ga=me of lying, cheating and stealing at least be intelligent enough to presen=t a plausible story.  To use phrases such as it was a hedge against fluctua=ting values in some of Enron's broadband telecommunications and other techn=ology investments is a complete insult to my intelligence and to the defini=tion of the word "HEDGE".  A hedge by definition implies that the upside an=d downside exposure has been limited.  It frightens me that we are out aski=ng customers to let Enron help them "HEDGE" their risk when I'm not sure En=ron's Senior Management understands what a hedge means?I'm also confused as to the personal financial involvement of Andy Fastow i=n the investment vehicle that generated this write down.  I must be confuse=d in that as a Trader Enron has asked me to sign documents declaring that I= will not have any personal financial involvement in anything involving the= Natural Gas Business.  This must be an example of as my father used to say= " do as I say not as I do"? I guess we need to have audits performed of Se=nior Managements financial interest to insure their actions are as good as =their word?The fact that Senior Management and the ENE Board of Directors knew these t=ransactions were being used to manipulate earnings and the stock price and =took advantage of that knowledge to sell their ENE stock options in my opin=ion is "CRIMINAL".  It provides me no comfort to know that the biggest perp=etrators of this fraud have left Enron in recent months.  These individuals= have stolen billions of dollars from ENE stockholders and Employees and ne=ed to pay the price for such fraudulent activity.  They are set for life, h=aving all the money they could ever need, while Employees and Stockholders =have lost their life savings.  You have completely failed at the job you we=re hired to perform.  If this type of activity would have occurred farther =down the organization no one would hesitate to fire the individuals involve=d and to institute criminal charges.  =20I for one can not wait until the All Employee meeting next week.  I do not =think anyone wants to hear about third quarter results because how could we= trust what is said anyway.  Instead I feel you owe the ENE Employee's a th=orough explanation of how you failed to perform your responsibilities, what= actions are going to be taken and most of all apologize for the job perfor=mance to date.=20

(ENE) Chief Executive Kenneth Lay couldreceive a lump sum payment as much as $80 million as a result of Dynegy Inc.'s(DYN) plan to acquire Enron, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesdayby the Securities and Exchange Commission.   Under Lay's employment agreement, which originally extended through Dec. 31,2003, Lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of fullcalendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by $20.2 million if heterminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control.   In August, Lay, chairman of Enron, resumed his position as CEO following theresignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's then-president and CEO. At thattime, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005.   In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for anyrelated tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an "excessparachute payment," according to the filing.   Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion.   The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay isentitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employmentwithin the 60 days.

The way I look at this is tha=t the liquids that are picked up in the gas stream as you withdraw from sto=rage is an unaccounted for gain.  As such, if the MMBtu enhancement percent=age was 1% I would use a withdrawal volume of 101% of the injection volume.=  We have to realize that in order to recognize this in the real world, the= Accounting Group would have to implement Accounting procedures that would =try to capture this value also.

Accounting would have to recognize the difference between the MMBtu fa=ctor on the gas withdrawn and the average MMBtu factor of the gas injected =as a gain.  We still need to live within the physical capacity constraints =This method more appropriately represents what you are gaining but increase=s your risk if the MMBtu enhancement percentage you use is too high!

Several questions come to mind related to this issue that I would appreciate your response:	1)  Please confirm the existence of such a clause or similar clause in Mr. Fastow's contract that would allow him a claim of additional money from an Enron entity.	2)  If such a clause does exist what is Enron's intent as far as payment or litigation?	3)  What other Enron employee's have such clauses that would allow them to benefit from the merger?Your clarification of the above questions would be appreciated!

As you and I discussed previously I do not fault anyone for wanting to t=ake their Deferred Values out subject to the 10% penalty.  After having str=uggled with the issue I do find a problem with the various interpretations =of how the ENE stock should be valued.  Any method other than  the number o=f shares times the current market value is not fair to the thousands of Enr=on employee's who had ENE shares in there 401K account and were not afforde=d a look back option.  Some might say this is easy for me since I did not h=ave ENE stock in either, but I do feel its a matter of treating everyone fa=irly.  Most employee's do not have access or knowledge of the Deferral Plan= so it would probably go unnoticed, but that would not be equitable.  The s=olution in my mind, if the plan participants do not agree would be to deny =an early single sum distribution which is a right, per my interpretation un=der the plan, this may encourage acceptance of the plans interpretation of =the ENE stock valuation.

This compares to the present 7500 BTU/horsepower-hr.  We need to come to a consensus on the assumptions that will be used with this figure.  These assumptions will need to be as follows:How many hours a year do we really think that these units will run?  I am assuming that they will not be running if Bammel is on withdrawal.  Correct or not?How much horsepower will really run?  This will be determined by how much market HPL will hope to capture from ANP and possibly Equistar.  It will also be affected by the suction pressure of the gas, which is, in turn, determined by how much HPL is injecting and pressures at Katy.Finally, what available run time do we want to assume here?  90%?I have no preconceived notions of what these assumptions should be; therefore, I am soliciting input from each of you.  We need to be in agreement before Emma starts her work.  Thank you.

john.lavorato@enron.com,john.lavorato@enron.com,john.lavorato@enron.com,Subject: VAR LIMITS,I know you are frustrated with the adherence to the VAR limits or lack there of, so I do not want to frustrate you more, but I would like you to consider the following suggestions.	1)  It does not seem logical that the VAR limit between the Central, East and Texas Desk be so far apart.  Under the current limits the Central desk can have 			a position 2,000 Contracts larger than Texas and the East Desk 1,000 Contracts larger. 	2)  When looking at performance YTD I wonder if higher VAR limits only gives the desks a greater ability to double down to try and make up the YTD losses.			VAR LIMITS		DESK P/L	   EAST	 	$10 MILLION		($66.1) MILLION	   CENTRAL	$12 MILLION		($13.9) MILLION	   TEXAS	$8  MILLION		$55.8   MILLION	3)  It also bothers me that everyone else does not hold the VAR limits in as high regard as Tom & I.  There are no consequences if the VAR limit is violated.  In fact 		in days like today you are rewarded for breaking the VAR limit. I feel that the following should be implemented in order to stress the importance of the VAR 		limit.			The P/L for any desk exceeding the VAR Limit by more than $500,000 will be decreased each day by the amount they exceeded the VAR limit.			(For example if a desks VAR limit is 10,000,000 and the VAR is $12,000,000 the P/L for the desk would be decreased by $2,000,000.  If the 				situation is not corrected by the next day the same procedure would be followed.)		This method I believe makes for an even playing field.  Under the current procedures what I'm learning is if you ignore the VAR limits and you are right no 		one will remember at year end and you are rewarded for breaking the rules.  Please give me your thoughts when you have a chance.	Thanks,  Jim

Economics are favorable to keep injecting.  I estimate that injections will average around 1TBTU per week through May 31, 2001 which would result in another 3+ TBTU beibng injected.  At the current pricing level this means that AEP would owe Enron somewhere around $98 million.  Is this something Accounting should be working into the AEP settlement to pay Enron on June 1, 2001?  Should AEP be notified of the volume and approximate value.  Is there anything that needs to be done contractually other than the original agrrement to facilitate this transaction?  I just wanted to make sure everyone is aware!  Please let me know your thoughts.

As we discussed earlier this year the Tax needs to be split between Enron and AEP based on the number of months ownership during the year.
