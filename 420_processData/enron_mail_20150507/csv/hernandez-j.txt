This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities.With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden.These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations.These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.John Lavorato & Louise Kitchen

You know you are at a SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY IF: 1.    Some of the guests didn't  bring a gift, but brought extra uninvited kids.2.    When the cake says "Happy  Birthday Mijo" instead of the child's real name.3.    The party is at Chuck E.  Cheese, but they brought their own food, cake, and a pinata.4.    It's a party, but there are  more grown-ups than children.5.    It's "Mijo's" 1st Birthday and  the party food is carne asada, arroz con frijoles puercos, y 10 cases of  beer.6.    For entertainment, instead of  playing pin the tail on the donkey, there is usually a televised baseball,  football game, or a live fight.7.    They don't sing Happy  Birthday, instead everyone is salsa dancing.8.    The party was over at 5:00,  it's 10:00 and the party is just starting.9.    You find out from Abuela that  Abuelo is taking viagra.10.    The host calls someone who's  on their way and tells them to stop and get some tortillas and ice.11.    The guests start arriving and  the hostess disappears to get ready.12.    You hear someone go up to the  birthday child and say "Mira, tan cute!"13.    Someone else says  "I'm  going to have to get you something next week when I get paid.14.    The party is Saturday, and  you get a call from the hostess Friday night saying, "I'm giving Mijo a birthday  party tomorrow at 3:00."15.    Some guests bring gifts that  are still in the store bag unwrapped.16.    There always seems to be more  family than friends at the party.17.    You have the party over at  your's brother's because he bought a new house and he has a pool.18.    The cake didn't come from the  store; it came from the mother of the comadre of your friend's sister who makes  really good cakes.19.    You are told you have to save  your plate and fork you ate your food with, so you can eat you  cake.20.    Someone calls and says they  can't make it, but asks that you save them some cake.21.    Guests are wrapping up cake  to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y el Junior.22.    The party music is coming  from a small boom box.23.    The birthday child is dressed  from head to toe in Tommy.24.    The birthday baby's Daddy  comes to the party and brings the kid he had before and after the Birthday  Baby.25.    It's "Mijo's" party, but  since his cousin Madonna is there and her birthday is in a few days, it becomes  Mijo's and Madonna's party. Power to la Raza I thought this was something to share with all  you REAL Mexicans and those who are still trying to get to know  us..........

Some of the guests didn't  bring a gift, but brought extra uninvited kids.2.    When the cake says "Happy  Birthday Mijo" instead of the child's real name.3.    The party is at Chuck E.  Cheese, but they brought their own food, cake, and a pinata.4.    It's a party, but there are  more grown-ups than children.5.    It's "Mijo's" 1st Birthday and  the party food is carne asada, arroz con frijoles puercos, y 10 cases of  beer.6.    For entertainment, instead of  playing pin the tail on the donkey, there is usually a televised baseball,  football game, or a live fight.7.    They don't sing Happy  Birthday, instead everyone is salsa dancing.8.    The party was over at 5:00,  it's 10:00 and the party is just starting.9.    You find out from Abuela that  Abuelo is taking viagra.10.    The host calls someone who's  on their way and tells them to stop and get some tortillas and ice.11.    The guests start arriving and  the hostess disappears to get ready.12.    You hear someone go up to the  birthday child and say "Mira, tan cute!"13.    Someone else says  "I'm  going to have to get you something next week when I get paid.14.    The party is Saturday, and  you get a call from the hostess Friday night saying, "I'm giving Mijo a birthday  party tomorrow at 3:00."15.    Some guests bring gifts that  are still in the store bag unwrapped.16.    There always seems to be more  family than friends at the party.17.    You have the party over at  your's brother's because he bought a new house and he has a pool.18.    The cake didn't come from the  store; it came from the mother of the comadre of your friend's sister who makes  really good cakes.19.    You are told you have to save  your plate and fork you ate your food with, so you can eat you  cake.20.    Someone calls and says they  can't make it, but asks that you save them some cake.21.    Guests are wrapping up cake  to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y el Junior.22.    The party music is coming  from a small boom box.23.    The birthday child is dressed  from head to toe in Tommy.24.    The birthday baby's Daddy  comes to the party and brings the kid he had before and after the Birthday  Baby.25.    It's "Mijo's" party, but  since his cousin Madonna is there and her birthday is in a few days, it becomes  Mijo's and Madonna's party.
