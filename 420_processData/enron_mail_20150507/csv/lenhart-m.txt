Haslett said to himself."He has the perfect arm!"So, he brings the kid to the New Orleansand teaches him the great game of football,and the Saints go on to win the Super Bowlfor the first time in history.The young Bosnian is "canonized"as the Great Hero of football,and when Haslett asks him what he wants,all the young man wants to dois to call his mother."Mom," he says into the phone,"I just won the Super Bowl.""I don't want to talk to you," the old woman says."You deserted us.  You are not my son.""I don't think you understand, Mother!" the young man pleads."I just won the greatest sporting event in the world.I'm here among thousands of my adoring fans.""No, let me tell you," the mother retorts."At this very moment, there are gunshots all around us.The neighborhood is a pile of rubble.Your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives yesterday,and today your sister was kidnapped in broad daylight."The old lady pauses, and then tearfully says " ...I'll never forgive you for making us move toNew Orleans."

From what I hear,everyone had an awesome time.  Celeste and I counted 12 weddings we gotinvited to this year between the two of us and also sometime this summer,Celeste and I are going to California to visit Alex and Kelly.  I'll leteveryone know about the invite, but it may be easier for you to let me knownext time you come in town.Send me your phone numbers again when you get a chance -Val___________________________________________________________Val GenereseCommerce Technology ConsultantHouston 83/75984, 713-837-5984            "Trahan, Don"            <TrahanIIID@aetna.com        To:     Val Generes@Accenture            >                            cc:                                         Subject:     Re: Congrats!            05/07/2001 03:13 PMFlorval,How's married life?  I wanted to congratulate you and Celeste.  Again,sorrywe were not able to make it down for the wedding.  I think it is safe toassume that the wedding was a bit more fun than the First Communion we wentto that Saturday.  I hope there are some good stories.  I am guessing youare back from the honeymoon at this point, and you guys had a great time.Hopefully, you will hold off on populating the earth with any moreFlorval's.  At least give everyone a few more years to begin preparations.I hope we can somehow try to get together in the near future.  I may try toget down there sometime late summer or fall.  Also, there is always an openinvitation at the Casa De Trahan here in DC (actually Northern VA - And tothink in my 1st 18 years, all I thought existed was the Westbank.  There isso much more!  Thought you might get a kick out of that comment).  Thisinvitation is good if anyone is passing through or would like to visit ournation's capitol (It's such a better place now that the 'White Trash' thatwas living in the 'White House' has moved out).  I know it not as cool asMelancon living 5 blocks from Wrigley, but you know?  The invite holds goodnot only for Mr.& Mrs Louis Florval Generes (what the hell is that?), butalso any of the other bums down in Houston that I have not seen if a fewyears.  Later Val.Donnie
