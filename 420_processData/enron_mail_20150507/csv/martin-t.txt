The guy who managed this deal for the desk left the Company but I thought he handed it off to Rick Hill in the estate.  I will talk to the rest of the guys on the desk and find out what we have on it and call you.  My basic understanding of this deal is that we provided services only and are agent for the plant.  I believe Rick Hill is the commercial contact on the deal so he should be able to provide more insight to the whole deal.  I will get back to you. Tom

I am sure that many of these people do not know each other and an environment where the group can mingle and enjoy some fun activities would be a great way to become more familiar with each other.  If we must have meetings/presentations, have them done by outside speakers so the group does not have to prepare presentations.  As far as where to go: Austin, San Antonio or Galveston are nice and will be reasonable for a group this size.  If you are ok with spending more the golfing, fishing and Spa activities in Florida (Miami, Key West, Tampa/St. Pete) are great.  Also golfing, rafting and Spa's in Colorado would be good too.I don't have a strong preference for where we go but I do believe that people would appreciate a focus on fun and getting to know each other.Tom

brian.redmond@enron.com,brian.redmond@enron.com,brian.redmond@enron.com,Subject: HPL Bidweek procedures,X-FileName: Martin, Thomas A..pstIt is my understanding that five AEP employees will in Enron's offices starting May 15th or 16th to get a better understanding of how to do the HPL trading and to direct the HPL bidweek activities for June (assuming close occurs for June).  To protect Enron's proprietary trading information for May and June I would like the AEP employees not to be allowed in the offices until after 10:30 AM for the duration of their stay.  From 7:30 - 10:30 AM is when the May business occurs and it is also when the communication occurs with HPL employees.Another issue is what happens if we believe that close is going to occur June 1 and then late in bidweek it gets delayed until July;  who wears the risk positions?  My suggestion is that if AEP is going to set up HPL activities for June then they should wear the risk positions.  The way to accomplish this is to do the following:	1.  The initial core term index physical position plus all thirty day index deals will be swapped out at gas daily index at the nearest relevant gas daily index 	     point (ie. HSC or Waha) after considering any volumes to be targeted for storage injections.	2.  Volumes targeted for storage injections up to 400,000/d purchased on IFGMR HSC index related pricing will be sold to AEP in the ground at June index 	     + actual storage costs.  Volumes targeted for storage are those volumes that can phyically get to Bammel storage.ExamplesCase 1Core term index position    100,000/d long  (50,000/d Waha, 50,000/d Texoma)Thirty day index position    200,000/d long  (volumes at Thompsonville and Katy)Total Index Position           300,000/d longVols. targeted for storage   200,000/dEnron sells AEP 200,000/d in storage at June IFGMR HSC index plus storage costs.  Any additional volumes would be sold to AEP at July index.  Enron sells 50,000/d gas daily swap at IFGMR Waha and 50,000/d gas daily swap at IFGMR HSC.Case 2Core term index position     200,000 short (50,000/d Waha, 150,000/d HSC)Thirty day index position     400,000 long   (50,000/d Waha, 100,000/d Agua Dulce, 100,000/d Thompsonville, 150,000/d Katy)Total Index Position            200,000 longVols. targeted for storage    200,000/dEnron sells AEP 200,000/d in storage at June IFGMR HSC index plus storage costs.

b..cass@enron.com,b..cass@enron.com,b..cass@enron.com,Subject: RE: Texas EOL transactions,From my perspective the Waha, Exxon Katy Tailgate and the new Carthage Tailgate product should be converted to ENA on the 18th if we find out that the close will occur June 1st.  Since the bidweek procedures we are proposing include AEP directing HPL activities for June during bidweek if we determine that close will occur June 1st, then it seems only logical that we should start operating as ENA at the same time.Thanks,Tom   
brian.redmond@enron.com,brian.redmond@enron.com,brian.redmond@enron.com,Subject: June Bidweek Procedures (additional),X-FileName: Martin, Thomas A..pstAn issue has come up that I did not consider in my prior discussions of how bidweek for June should be managed prior to knowing if we close or not.  Physical deals for June have started to happen already.  If close does occur and all the deals prior to May 18th are done as HPL then ENA will miss out on a lot of potential business for June.  So I believe a fair solution is to have all deals in locations that are most relevant to HPL (ie. Agua Dulce, Thompsonville, Oasis Katy, Lonestar Katy, Texoma) be done as HPL; deals in a location such as Katy Tailgate that is relevant to HPL and ENA will be split evenly HPL and ENA and written up as two separate purchases.  Waha is not considered here since AEP already has a Waha trader who is active in the market.Thanks,Tom

The potential upside of the Entex Audit is more like $2 - $3 million but our ability to recover that much is questionable given the weak contract language for resolving non-performance.  In the past ENA and Entex resolved volume shortfalls under the term contract by extending the term.  Obviously we will not have that remedy.  Do not let AEP separate other issues away from this and try to pick us to death.Tom

I just wanted to drop you a line to tell you that it appears the ESOP rollover into Savings Plan ocurred as we discussed last week.  I got into the Savings Plan on Friday 11/23 and moved the Enron shares to Stable Assets also as we discussed.  It appears that the price used was Monday's close of $4.01 instead of Friday's close of $4.71.So where do we go from here?  I am assuming per our previous meeting that whether $4.01 or $4.71 is used; that one of these prices will be used to keep me whole versus a price sometime in September (probably September 30th) when the ESOP shares should have been put into the Savings Plan.Please call me at you earliest convenience to resolve this.Thanks,Tom

I have also talked to EPrime who is our supplier and they are buying back this 21,417/d from Enron at IFGMR HSC - .08.  They will subsequently sell the gas to Woodward directly at IFGMR HSC - .08.  Both EPrime and Woodward agree that HSC - .08 is a fair market value for Carthage volumes during bidweek for December.  The purpose of this transaction is to mitigate the risk of physical non-performance by Enron given our current financial condition without impacting the contractual pricing of the deals previously done with Eprime and Woodward respectively.Regards,Tom Martin

We have very large positions and people are becoming more frustrated with the work environment, uncertain about future employment and now with new information about Lay's "golden parachute", I am concerned that not everyone may act in the best interest of the Company (hero or zero attitude) or at a minimum may not be in the best frame of mind to trade.  I hate to suggest it but do you need to reduce the people allowed to take risk for the Company? (similar to what was done when we sold HPL).  The general feeling is that everyone at the top is taking care of themselves and the "little" people that have been making the money for the Company are left out in the cold.  I also suggest that you move quickly to ensure appropriate compensation for key traders into next year.I know the first move I suggested would have the effect of reducing morale further but this group has a lot of risk on for people that may not be 100% commited to Enron.  This may be too drastic action at this point but I think it should watched closely.

It sounds like Shanna feels threaten by you and others being friendly to this new girl.  I know it is hard but some how you need to reassure Shanna that you being nice to the new girl does not mean she (Shanna) is less of your friend.  Maybe the best approach is to ask Shanna how she would feel if she had to move to a new school and was treated badly by some of the new girls she met.  You and Shanna have been friends for a long time and you don't want to lose that, but she needs to know that you will continue to welcome new kids that come school and it does not impact your friendship with her.To answer your question, things are OK.

Given the current uncertainty about NETCO headcount and considering any transition issues you may have with Chris leaving, I thought we should leave things the way they are for now but develop a transfer date to be in a week or two.  If you are OK with this move, I would like Chris to spend part of his time next week downloading from Daren as I have him through next Friday.On another matter, I believe Daren has E-mailed you about an agency agreement that we have with Cleburne Plant that needs to be transitioned to the estate.  He knows the details as does Rick Hill (I believe he is in your group).  We should probably get someone else in your group plugged into this deal (Kathy Kelly?), to handle to the administration of this deal.  We should try to identify someone quickly so that he/she can download from Daren next week.Tom

He still wanted to talk to Scott Neal about a potential cash trading role on the East desk.  In the same breath he said that he welcomed an opportunity that had some commercial aspects but did not require running a book (which the East desk job would probably require).

Right now Daren Farmer is evaluating an opportunity with AEP.  If he stays and if we get pressure for another round of cuts; I may be in a situation that I have to do something with Dave.  If Daren leaves then Dave is really the only one remaining with Waha experience, that is why I decided to move him to the desk.  Bottom line to me is that based on discussions with you in the past and my experience, Dave is definitely a keeper for Risk and has gained some physical experience in the last six months that will help me out particularly if Daren leaves.  Needless to say there are a lot of variables to manage here but I thought you should be aware it, particularly if I end up in a situation where I have to make more cuts.I am sure you are in a similar situation with some of your folks so you can probably relate to what I am going through.  I will catch up with you as this unfolds but if possible don't completely put Dave out of your plans at this point.

I guess I will have to move him into the Associate program or Logistics.

They are asking now to a proposal of minimum 5 years, and upto 12 if we can make it. So they will be taking the risk of not having a fuel supply that matches de 25 year Power Purchase Agreement.2.- The Points of Sale will be in the U.S. Mexico Border, so we will not have to get an export permit of any sort.3.- Swing: This is going to be a base load plant, that will be dispatched around 90% on a yearly average.  However CFE has the right to take zero power at their full discretion, so Edf does not wsant to take the risk of not being dispatched and not being able to swing down to zero during the 25 years of the gas supply.  However, the plant will most certainly displace other less efficient plants in the first 10 years, so that such risk is much lower. In our proposal we can include either zero swing or which ever we feel we are the most competitive. They will evaluate whether such risk could be taken by them. 4.- Modifying Swing every 2 years.  They believe that in the long run (25 years), the dispatching rules or conditions of the plant could change. So they want to have the option to review the swing every 2 years. Can we price this optionality ? Is there a re-purchase of such optionality in the market ? 5.- Resale formula. They need us to include a daily re-sale fomula for the gas not taken.6.- Other Provisions: We need to review the other provisions in the RFP and tell them which ones can we comply with and which ones we don't. I am faxing you the entire RFP, together with the latest letter we received from them. Please give me a call whenevr you have a chance.   Best regards.

My initial research of Large Cars and Luxury Cars in Consumer Report did not yield a lot of obvious choices to me.  I only considered CR "Recomended " cars.  There are a few options in the $20,000 to $25,000 range for example the Ford Crown Victoria/Mecury Grand Marquis; but I do not believe the cars in this price range will give them the same luxury and comfort that they are used to.  The only car in the $30,000 to $35,000 range is the Buick Park Avenue which I think will be a pretty close fit to what they are driving now but I'm not sure they want to spend this kind of money.  Of course the really nice luxury cars that will sure to satisfy them for example, the Lincoln Town Car and Cadillac Deville are in the $40,000 to $45,000 range.Dad said he spent $23,000 for his Olds 98 in 1991 and would like to have something that rides as quite and comfortable as it but not spend big bucks.

Jim took a lap top computer with him and is reachable by cell phone.  Kim has our pager and cell phone numbers.  I will be calling in to see how Eric is doing and to see if any of my folks have any questions about their employment contracts.  I asked Philip to keep an eye on Eric as well.  Eric sat in the morning meeting today and will fill for me next week.Thanks,Tom

john.lavorato@enron.com,john.lavorato@enron.com,john.lavorato@enron.com,Subject: Texas Desk Employee Matters,I received notice today that Elsa Villareal , Gary Lamphier and Ed Gottlob have accepted jobs with AEP as part of the sale of HPL (not to leave until closing).    This means that my staffing needs after closing are as follows:1 Lead Physical Trader1 Physical Trader1 Basis Trader (or at least an asst. trader)1 Industrial/Utility Middle Marketer/Originator1 Supply Middle Marketer/OriginatorI met with Jeanie Slone and the internal recruiters today to start the external search process for an experienced physical trader and industrial marketer.I am hoping the other positions can be filled internally with associates and/or internal commercial personnel.I delivered employment contracts to Janet Wallis, Jim Schwieger, Stacy Neuweiller, Eric Bass and Daren Farmer.  They all wanted to review the documents and talk to me next week about it.  Janet did not give a good feeling that she would be willing to sign it.  I know that she has been contacted by companies other  than AEP about job opportunities and I know other Enron Units have talked to her as well.Although we met Jim's numbers he is still hung up on the super vesting language for options; I'll keep working on him.The others I did not get any read on, but I will talk to them next week.Given the severe shortage of talent that my desk is going to experience from the HPL transaction I want you to consider realocating experienced talent from other trading and middle marketing desks to the Texas desk.I will follow up with you when I return from vacation on Monday, March 19th.Thanks,Tom
george.weissman@enron.com,george.weissman@enron.com,george.weissman@enron.com,Subject: Re: Guadalupe Power Partners LP,Yes, this deal should go to AEP with the HPL transaction.  The reason there are no forward volumes booked is because they have a monthly election to nominate baseload gas daily priced gas or wait and nominate daily volumes priced at gas daily.  At any rate there is no way to know in forward months what they are going to take subject to contractual maximums.  If you have any further questions let me know.Thanks,Tom

Her recommendation is to look on the Enron Job Seeker website to see if there are any specific jobs that may be of interest to you.Call me if you after you look at the website and let me know if there are any opportunities that make sense for you.Tom

I don't anticipate buying much Clear Lake gas other than the short that we have there (6,500/d I think).Tom
