Currently the energy payments are indexed to Socal Border because a majority of the Edison QF's buy spot gas.  If this settlement happens, the QF's will likely want to buy financial swaps.  The Edison gas-fired QF's represent about 500MMCF/Day of gas.Chris

"We do not expect the California situation to have any significant effect on Enron's financial outlook, specifically our ability to hit 2001 targets," Jeff Skilling, the president and chief operating officer of North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas, said in a conference call with analysts. Skilling also said there hadn't been any significant impact on fourth quarter earnings, noting that Enron did not own electricity generation assets in California, where rolling electricity blackouts were imposed last week and the state's top two utilities are running out of money as they face soaring wholesale electricity costs. Having sold electricity to the state's main utilities, generating companies such as Reliant Energy Inc. <REI.N> and Dynegy Corp. <DYN.N> are now at risk of not receiving payments from Pacific Gas and Electric, a unit of PG&E Corp. <PCG.N>, and Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International <EIX.N>. At the same time, some have claimed that power generators have taken advantage of the crisis by over-charging the state's utilities, which, as part of deregulation, cannot pass on skyrocketing electricity prices to consumers. "California is a much smaller percentage of our overall earnings than some of the other energy companies, particularly generators," Skilling said, adding that the company only participates in the merchant business of buying and selling electricity. "The bottom line is this: We are not overexposed in California or anywhere else for that matter." Shares of Enron rose $2-3/8 to $73-7/16 on the New York Stock Exchange after it reported earnings before nonrecurring items rose 34 percent, to $347 million in the fourth quarter.

However,  I am having a big problem getting Tudor and like funds up and running on EOL-Problems:#1: Credit- major back-log on new names - we don't have enough resources to deal with these names (the structures of the funds can be complex- not like dealing with industrials).  #2: With those that we have docs, credit has said we can not trade on-line. (???)The only differences I see with funds trading online is that their trades need to go to credit's (Bill Bradford's group) to be included in daily MTM and 5 day VAR reports.  We calculate variation margin off these reports so its essential credit gets the trades...ANDIn the case of Tudor, they allocate trades between funds- the EOL trades would need to go to me or the backoffice, so we could allocate them.I think the EOL reporting issues can easily be resolved- the credit back log is the real killer at the moment.Rgds,CarolineAndy Zipper01/22/2001 11:15 AMTo:	Caroline Abramo/Corp/Enron@Enroncc:	 Subject:	Re:   Now that gas options have been launched how are they being received ?

The quality may not resemble the first session we had but I thought it would be worth it if we can find a couple more folks to put in the program.  We will probably have a much bigger one later in the year after the new analysts and associates join.  I had a couple of observations from last time.1.  I think we were too hard on external candidates.  There are 5 or 6 external candidates.  Remember that they don't have the Enron grounding that the internal candidates have.  Most of them are not in the Gas or Electricity industry.  Try to evaluate them on their intrinsic qualities.2.  Some people have not thought about trading concepts and are unfamiliar with trading lingo.  That doesn't mean that they will not be good traders one day. I think we were a little biased based on someones ability to run a stack tommorrow.  RegardsJohn

This has not presented a problem since we still have acess to the online database as long as we are the reporting entity for the Bammel storage facility.  One thing to keep in mind is that when we sell HPL, we will need to subscribe to the AGA at a cost of about $100,000 per year in order to keep the online access which is critical for the weekly AGA stoage numbers.  (Bloomberg reports the same numbers 2 minutes later, and per the traders those are VERY critical seconds).Regards,Julie  :-)<Embedded StdOleLink>

The future success is unclear but the exercise was very worthwhile.*  Had very few VAR violations and helped improve our understanding and reporting of VAR.  Completed mended the relationship between gas trading and the risk group.*  Should get most credit for the increase in power trades on EOL and the continuation of the increase in Gas.*  Turned the East Power group into a focused trading group not a think tank that bets on July-Aug power price - Still nowhere near completion.*  Put a halt on the hiring of unqualified people - Have spent many hours devising a plan to bring in qualified - experience people.  You will see this implemented in 2001.*  Experimented with the "Pay PRC"  which I think was very successful.  I think this will start our organization to think a little differently and hopefully in a way that will benefit us.*  Possibly the best accomplishment is "Killing the Dragon".I'm glad you made me write this list down because for the first time in months I realized that I was smiling while I was writing.RegardsJohn

Texas desk VaR dropped to $3.8FrankPS.  Bilal has been very helpful in dealing with the VAR issues, and I think it has given him a better idea of what trading is about.  Would you consider sharing some of the analyst/traders, much like Bilal, for a couple of months, maybe longer, maybe mornings only, to help on VAR issues, as it relates to both power and gas?  I think it would be an excellent way to introduce them to VAR, systems, risk management and trading.  Let me know your thoughts

The changes made were in correcting the handing of contract rolls and correcting some of the roll dates.The model still gives a higher profit, sometimes, for the cases of 1,000,000 bbl position limit vs.  5,000,000 bbl limit.   I took a look in detail at the 5 MM bbl case which gave lower profit (3 yrs out of Nov 95).   The intuition is that there are two offsetting things which happen when you raise the position limit.1) you have a larger position to profit from when the market reverses a trend, but2) you loose much more money in a long term trending market, and to the extent that you still hit your position limit, you will not make it all back when the market reverses.In the specific above case, you hit the position limits for both 1 MM bbl and 5 MM bbl, and the superior strategy is a trade off between limiting losses vs. having a larger position from which to gain on major market reversals.--StinsonOpen to Close			Continuous trading

I don't have every detail yet, but I wanted to fill you in because this is moving quite quickly.TDC Energy is a small privately owned producer that had several deals with CES that ENA acquired in last year's transaction.  Four of those transactions were costless collars that are deep in the money for us.  TDC is disputing the existence of these collars because CES never sent confirmations for them.   We have taken the position with CES that if TDC defaults it is CES' exposure, not ENA's.  The total value of these collars as of today is approximately $4,800,000.   I have been working with Jeff Hodge on this issue and we believe that, because of several different reasons, ENA should file the lawsuit with TDC jointly.  I'll be happy to meet with you if you're interested and explain the reasons for this.In addition, ENA has other deep in the money fixed priced transactions with TDC worth an estimated $5,000,000 (unofficially from R. Diamond in Credit)   TDC has not disputed these transactions and so far all is fine with these; however, we fear that TDC may be facing financial difficulties--if they go bankrupt, we have exposure on the $5,000,000 of fixed price transactions, plus potentially all or part of the other $4,800,000 of financial collars.  Jeff Hodge is meeting today with CES' outside attorneys to discuss where we should file the lawsuit and I get the impression that it is already drafted and will be filed very soon.  Please let me know if you want to talk through this.

Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success. I would like suggestions as to:1)  Where to go.2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 4)  And any other ideas you have.In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.    RegardsJohn

The critical decision is to leave EES direct-access customers on that tariff. Alternatively, if the PUC rules to end the rate freeze, eliminates the existing CTC credits and does not allow EES customers to switch to this tariff, we stand to lose somewhere between $600-650 million, as EES would have to serve their customer loads by buying expensive CA power during 2001.A 10% increase in tariff rates results in ~$50 million loss for EES. However, if the tariff is extended beyond 2001, it will create additional value for EES (the tariff is lower than Cal-02 power prices). CA Gov. Davis met with Clinton yesterday where they have decided to extend the emergency status in the state.Ken Lay is scheduled to meet with Davis today to address the following topics:	- clarify any inaccurate information about Enron's role in CA markets	- urge the Governor to not go overboard with this situation and give the "world" to the CA utilities	- remind about the upside PG&E and SCE will realize from high valuations of hydro plants (increased almost three-fold from a year ago)Hearings and oral arguments will continue this week. CA PUC decision is expected to come on Jan-4th, followed by multiple appeals.Credit issues:	- Enron is attempting to reduce credit exposure with PG&E, whereby PG&E will assign its out-of-the-money trades with Avista and MS to EPMI and 	  EES will assign its in-the-money positions with PG&E to EPMI, creating an off-set. These assignments will reduce PG&E exposure by ~$265 MM, 	  in exchange for Avista and MS exposures.	- PUC is not likely to rule removal of retail tariff retroactively (to May 99) - this will enforce EES position in collecting its accounts receivable from 	  PG&E of ~$150 MM (so far, they have not paid Enron on the premise of retroactive ruling).Market Risk:12/27 VaR is $7.8 MM - limit violation. An increase of $0.5 MM because of:	- addition of long Feb-01 positions at MidC	- overall increase in prices	- incorrectly booked trades at PJM (50 MWs Cal-03 Long instead of a Short)My suggestion, at a high level, to Don Black and Dennis Benevides to sell MWs in both East and West in order to reduce VaR. However, because of the holidays the liquidity in the market is very scarce.Vlady.

We can include the sithe agreement in the master netting agreement although we do not believe that this will work for Dynegy as it is not a forward contract but an annuity stream which cannot be accelerated, however if they think it works - fine.  We would not want the margin calculated net (it needs to be exclusive of this transaction).  If they were to convert to two swaps in order to allow for acceleration in the master netting agreement, there is an accounting issue for us.2.  In the East we are long physical power from them in the markets which are not pools.  We are short to them in the pools which clear financially and we have no issues in the pools.  So we do not need to do anything.  I'll have the west soon. 3.  We will have our physical gas position by point soon.  We will agree to prepay for all of Dec but we should only pay day by day.
