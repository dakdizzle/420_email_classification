One, we are showing you physical markets on the price indications and EOL is strickly financial and for a specific product.  There are many differences in these two products, depending on term, physical premiums, the trader's position, etc.  Two, the price indications that you receive are based on yesterday's markets.  EOL is a real time current market price for the specific product listed.  Give me a call if you have any more questions and we can discuss further.thanks,Kim

What do most people do on a date? Dates are for having fun, and people should use them  to get to know each other.  Even boys have something to say if you listen  long enough.--Lynette, age 8 On the first date, they just tell each other lies,  and that usually gets them interested enough to go for a second date. --Martin,  age 10What would you do if a date was not working  out?  I'd run home and play dead.  --Craig, age   When is it okay to kiss someone? When they're rich. --Pam,age 7 The law says you have to be eighteen, so I wouldn't  want to mess with that.  --Curt, age   The rules goes like this:  If you kiss someone,  then you should marry them and have kids with them.  It's the right thing  to do. --Howard, age 8How would the world be different if people weren't  married? There sure would be a lot of kids to explain,  wouldn't there?  --Kelvin, age 8 What is the right age to get married?  No age is good to get married at.  You got to be  a fool to get married.  --Freddie, age 6 Is it better to be single or married?  It's better for girls to be single but not for  boys.  Boys need someone to clean up after them.  --Anita, age 9 I don't know which is better, but I'll tell you one  thing, I'm never going to have sex with my wife.  I don't want to be all  grossed out. --Theodore, age 8How do you decide who to marry? You got to find somebody who likes the same  stuff.  Like if you like sports, she should like it that you like sports,  and she should keep the chips and dip coming.  --Alan, age 10No person really decides before they grow up who  they're going to marry. God decides it all way before, and you get to find out  later who you're stuck with. --Kirsten, age 10How can a stranger tell if two people are  married? You might have to guess, based on whether they seem  to be yelling at the same kids. --Derrick, age 8 What do your mom and dad have in  common? Both don't want any more kids.  --Lori, age   How would you make a marriage work?  Tell you wife that she looks pretty even if she looks  like a truck. --Ricky, age 10

It is similar to the initial proposal that I have made to other municipalities in northern California.  However, many changes were made and negotiated based on several factors.  Some of those factors include the types of customers behind your city gate (residential, power generation), what your load profile is correlated to (weather), transport owned, and other services requested.  Also, the type of pricing you are looking for can affect the structure.  Call me on Tuesday and we can talk about the City of Roseville more specifically.

They asked for a ball park and I could not help them.  Would it make a difference if we did 20 year index (for baseload) with gs daily for the swing?  Due to credit requirements from others we are competeing with on this, they are considering an index with the supplier with Noresco doing an internal financial swap with a sister company, perhaps Equitable.  what do you think?  I will keep you posted on discussions.Thanks!Kim

Even with load growth and, asset divestiture they wouldn't face the facts that the supply/demand picture was messed up.  They wanted all of the plants to be built in other states such as Arizona and Nevada.Environmentalists (fish people) were trying to get rid of the hydro dams in the Pac NW.  It is definitely an issue they, as well as California will experience this year as the dams are only filled to 55% of normal.  This equates to approximately 3000-4000 MWh short.  Typically in the summer, the pac NW exports about 4200 MWH to California.  Guess what - there will be no exports this summer.  The light WILL go out in Cali!!!!

I will keep you posted.KimTo:	Kim Ward/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:	 Subject:	Re: Fwd: Citizens Gas Supply Offer - PPL counter proposal   Kim:Please review and add anything you want and return.CJohn/Sean:A few thoughts on the Griffith deal:1.  Term:  PPL indicates they want to do the deal through 2003.  That is really 2003 - 2004 as it incldues Nov - Mar.  Extension until this time might require extension of our underlying deal.  This would be OK with us.2.  Character of service:   The text indicates that PPL would have the right to request deliveries be made to an alternqate point on TW.  Why would they want this?  This could be a problem if we know the gas wouldn't flow as we would shut in puchases.  We would like to make this on a mutually acceptable basis.3.  Pricing:  Does the reservation cahrge include variable transport?  I think that is what we proposed.  If not, then the Commodity rate flow needs to include the variable cost of  transport plus fuel.4.  Conditions:  Noms must be in at 8:00 am.  This is very important and the a deal killer.  We need time to manage the position.  Also, the weekend issue needs to be addressed.  As we have discussed, weekends trade as the same quantity each day.  If they want to vary the daily amoount during the weekend and make Sunday higher than Sat or Monday, that is fairly ewaasy to deal with.  If they want to have lower takes on Sunday, this is more difficult ad increases costs.  We might be able to craft a solution to this however.Chris   	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

As you can see, there are slight differences between my calculations and John Cogans. the main issue is as follows:1)Calculation of the spread - he is taking the greater of PG&E topock minus $.10 minus pipeline demand charges OR SJ + fuel.  This can create a negative spread value equal to pipeline commodity charges (which we are reimbursed for).  The results of all of this is mulitplied by $.085.  I am assuming that the floor for the spread is SJ, therefore, the spread = zero if it does turn out to be less than zero.I hope you have time to review - Once this is fixed you are done - just collecting money.

Now you are sure to get an earful!  Beware - My country is at war and going into a major recession, my company is falling down around my feet, my grandmother is sick,  I am broke, and my boyfriend broke up with me last week, further confirming my ability to fail when it comes to relationships.  ( I know I act tought when it comes to this stuff but I am really sad about this one)  I guess that I am not sick and I do have lots of friends.  But I am tired and need someone to take over at this point - - - - I can't believe that you didn't get my email about gas being a buy a couple of weeks ago.  I guess if I had seen you when I was there, I could have told you in person.  AS for business over here, gas and power trading is still going strong.  However, all of the events have affected us in a huge way financially.  Down to whether we get bonuses or not.  It is not going to be a good year just trying to stay strong but I think that we will survive, and mostly thanks to EnronOnline.Curious about what's going on there since you mentioned it.  Anyway - sorry to burden you with my personal problems.  I do hope things are going ok for you - too bad you're not going to make it here.  As we are in a cash crunch, I think I am probobly grounded for the remainder of the year.  Who knows!Keep in touch -K.

You didn't have to leave - I am glad you came though.  Hope we can do it again sometime - once I get over this hump.  (See, I am still insecure and a disaster when it comes to relationships! and I hadn't even gone there in 5 years!)Take care and keep in touch.kim

I was unaware of this until late in the day Dec. 5.  Therefore, it is my interpretation, under section 12 of the contract, Enron is not providing sufficient gas supply to the City on this day.  The City of Mesa should determine its best course of action based on the terms of the contract given the fact that Enron did not schedule gas for December 6th.  Please notify me of any new supply or other course of action, as soon as possible.Please let me know if you have any questions.Thanks,Kim
