We don't have a "one off form" for US power trading, but it may be possible to use the US GTCs (3 pages) - this document contemplates multiple trades but is shorter than EEI.

Success always comes at a price - great job winning out the financial vs. physical debate.

We have come a long way, howe=ver, and only 2 serious issues remain open.  (All the others are at least m=ostly resolved -- see my 5/1/01 revision w/ marginal notes made during my 5=/2/01 meeting w/ them.)  This file is in my office with all the others.XOM requires that all of its contracts contain 2 provisions, both of which =are problematic for Enron.(1)  The Federal Contractor Supplement -- exhibit F to the EEI Master -- is= designed to assure XOM's compliance w/ the U.S. federal government's requi=rements imposed on all government contractors.  There are 2 categories of r=equirements:  environmental laws compliance and small business participatio=n in federal govt purchases of goods and services.  Since XOM has adoped a ="General Commercial Plan" to comply with such requirements, XOM has promise=d the U.S. govt that ALL its contracts will contain these provisions.  And =that's what the auditors from the U.S. government would be looking to ascer=tain in a review of XOM's compliance.  As for Enron, we do engage in busine=ss w/ the U.S. govt, but we have not adopted a "General Commercial Plan," s=o we have to address these issues on an ad hoc basis.  Taking the last para=graph of this Supplement as an example (addressing the use of women and min=ority owned businesses by Enron in supplying services to XOM under this con=tract), at this point, Enron isn't really prepared to undertake such things= and all those I dealt with on this seem a bit nervous about Enron's abilit=y to comply.  I've communicated w/ Michelle Cash, George Wasaff, and Cathy =Riley (at Calvin Eakins direction) on this topic, and I asked Cathy Riley t=o have her director, Calvin Eakins, phone me to discuss this further, but h=e did not call.  And there does not seem to be a very good solution to this=.  XOM has suggested revising the language in Sec. 10.13 (based on my 5/1/0=1 draft) to add a final sentence "The Federal Contract Supplement is attach=ed as Exhibit F and each Party shall comply with such requirements to the e=xtent appplicable."  This certainly takes care of all of XOM's concerns, bu=t I'm not sure this gets Enron all the way where we need to be.  See, for e=xample, Dave Nutt's markup of the environmental provisions (in the file), a=nd Cathy Riley says there are no exceptions or exemptions to the small busi=ness requirements.  We might be able to get some outside expertise on this =or get Sharon Butcher to help resolve it.(2)  Limitation of Damages -- Article 7 waives consequentials, etc. for bot=h parties.  XOM insists that this provision must carve out damages resultin=g from the "gross negligence and/or willful misconduct attributable to its =managerial and senior supervisory personnel".  You can see the full details= of the provisions they're looking for in the XOM language in sec 10.4 (sam=e draft), the extensive indemnity language which they added in the last rou=nd and which we generally don't mind giving them.  But this impacts Article= 7 because the Enron version of the waiver expressly states that the waiver= applies to indemnities, and, of course, XOM will not tolerate any exceptio=ns to the liability of each party (yes, it's mutual) for the gross negligen=ce of its managers, etc.  There's a true story behind all this that dates b=ack to the EPA emissions requirements on Reformulated Gasoline (RFG).  Mobi=l hired a lab to do the testing, the managers of the lab company encouraged= the testing staff to "fudge" the results, tons of RFG hit the market that =was not in compliance, and a huge black mark on Mobil and zillions of dolla=rs lost were the result.  And the contract provided that the lab's damages =were limited to the testing fees, and apparently, that worked for the lab c=ompany.  So, it's a deal breaker for XOM  b/c they say that if Enron's mana=gers decide to turn off the lights at all the refineries for some specious =reason, they need to have proper recourse against Enron.   I''ve argued wit=h them about this, based on the nature of this contract, the power trading =business, etc. but to no avail .....  It would seem that Enron's language i=n Art. 7, w/ the following rather narrow change, might work for both partie=s, but it's up to you, now.=09UNLESS EXPRESSLY HEREIN PROVIDED, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR CONS=EQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOST PROFIT=S OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, BY STATUTE, IN TORT OR CONTRACT, =UNDER ANY INDEMNITY PROVISION OR OTHERWISE provided, however, that nothing =in this Article 7 shall be interpreted to limit either Party's liability un=der Article 10.4(b). =20Let me know if you have any questions about this. =20Regards,JaniceEB3811Assistant General Counsel, Enron North America Corp.713-853-1794 (Fax:  713-646-3490)

I attach a sample of some our standard changes for your information.  We also add others from time to time.  Our position on issues depends upon the counterparty involved.  Feel free to amend choice of law, confirming party (which by the way sometimes EPMI also changes) and whatever else you want assuming you think appropriate for your dealings.  On typos, we know they exist but question whether there is anything misleading.  (We were under tremendous pressure to "release" the document - after release we do not want to "re-release" unless something is misleading.)  If you want to fix, feel free to do so in the cover page.    This is a sample of EPMI's older cover page amendmentsElizabeth Sager713-853-6349

I like the proposal to merge the discussions but... You will recall at the WSPP meeting in Colorado I asked Mike Small if he wouldn't consider merging the discussions/ contracting groups.  After a long winded story about the personal pain he has and will continue to suffer (Shari's name came up a lot), he said he did not think it would ever work.  I'm all for trying to forge this single contract approach and I think EEI members, drafting committee and all, would relish it as well.  What do you think is the next best step?  ps - the meeting in San Diego on the 1st is still unclear for Houston based Enron employees.  Terrorists Halloween scares have made everyone unlikely willing to fly.  We are trying to get Mike to allow a videoconference but so far no commitment that this is OK.  Lets talk about this also.Hoping not to stay the course, again.  Talk to you soon.Elizabeth Sager713-853-6349

This language forms the basis for what is inserted into physical and financial confirmations for power index-based deals.  The underlying confirmations may also contain conforming language depending upon the delivery point and the counterparty.  This language is updated/revised periodically as indexes change, new information becomes available and/or to fit the agreed upon transaction.
