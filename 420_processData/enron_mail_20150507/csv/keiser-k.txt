c..gossett@enron.com,c..gossett@enron.com,c..gossett@enron.com,Subject: promotions,O'neal Winfree currently manages the Texas risk management group for natural gas and is also responsible for the benchmark reporting group.  He works closely with the Desk director and other traders to ensure accurate reporting of the positions and P&L's.  He has eliminated most OA variances on his desk and has helped the other regions as well.  O'neal and his group recently created a new physical P&L reporting tool to assist the risk and trading groups.  Scott Palmer is currently the East desk lead and was the central desk lead prior to that.  He set up and managed the Wellhead region and created new reporting tools for the traders to manage their supply.  He was also responsible for calculating and reporting the Virginia Natural Gas asset management book and worked closely with the structuring group and others at VNG and Sequent to resolve any issues or questions.   James Hungerford has been a book administrator on the East region for the past six months.  He quickly became an important part of the team by managing up to three traders' P&L's and making numerous improvements to our daily routines such as streamlining the Weapon-X database, automating the new deal checkout and implementing a daily VaR estimate process.  Prior to risk management, James was the Operational Analysis coordinator for the east region and worked with risk management and other downstream groups to clean-up all past variances and helped eliminate future problems.

I know not everyone will have physical but to keep it consistent everyone will have both just in case.  I have the 10 names you sent Jeff earlier, please let me know if that changes.  Do you know what the structure going to look like? ie.  will each trader be assigned specific curves/locations, cash vs. term, how many different people will be setting curves.We will be starting over with our curve files also.  We want to only start with the true published curves.  We have many derived/internal curves that aren't necessary and if we need to create more curves we will look into it later.  Since the number of curves will be greatly reduced, we will probably start with one file.    ThanksKam

Everyone needs to be here no later than 8:00am, 7:30 once we start trading again2.	No playing on the internet or other games (ex. cards) - this will no longer be tolerated3.	I have said this many times before but this is the ideal time to LEARN.		bring in your options books or anything else that you can read to learn more about the energy industry		start studying the firms rolls, learn what the macros do, develop new checks and balances		become more familiar with forwards and options details and other excel queries and where the curves come from		understand the curve files (these will change but the general format will be similar)		Just to be clear, this is coming down from Jeff Gossett.  The list for NetCo. is not set in stone and can be changed if someone steps up, or if someone doesn't.We are still getting paid everyday and should be putting our time into the company.I know it has been boring but things need to change starting today, things will start to pick up in the next few days.The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14th.I would like to get your ideas for changes/improvements to our current processes/systems.  We have a slightly improved firm roll to use but nothing else has changed.This is our chance to change the things we couldn't before.  There is no reason why we have to continue doing things the same as before.Please seriously think about this over the next few days and get back to me with any ideas you have, no matter how small, every little bit helps.Come talk to me if you have any questions or concerns,Thanks,Kam

We won't be calculating this book but I'm wondering if the deals will still liquidate for Jim's (or whoever) schedule.  If they do, we will have huge OA because we killed the swaps on those physical deals, meaning the desk and customer prices will be the same.  We'll see those variances, and at the same time Financial acct. should see a variance because the deals liquidated but were not "flashed" in our P&L's.

O:\erms\erms_adm\netco\unused books.  Rather than deleting these, they will remain here until they are needed.  The NGP&L will link to these, once they are needed we will start saving it to the regions file and the links will be updated.  There is also a hedgestrip saved for each book to the live and unused books files. We should also start creating a common file for each region to post the P&L to the website.  Let's try to keep these the same format.  East has a good file that shows new deals and     curveshift.  West used a macro to pull in finished P&L's instead of updating links which eliminated some problems, Randy could help with this.  Figure out what format you want and use that for all regions.   I think everyone agrees that we don't want to give them a positions file like in the past, they should use TDS for that.
