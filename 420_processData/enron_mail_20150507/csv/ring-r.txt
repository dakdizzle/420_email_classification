h..foster@enron.com,h..foster@enron.com,h..foster@enron.com,Subject: RE: Riverside Contract Draft,Chris,I have reviewed the Confirmation Letter and have the following comments and/or questions:PREAMBLEPARAGRAPH ONECompany name should be Riverside County Waste Management Department.PREAMBLEPARAGRAPH TWOThere are various references to "this SC Agreement", which is not a defined term anywhere; should the reference to "this SC Agreement" really mean "this Confirmation Letter" or "this Master Agreement"?ARTICLE 2SECTION 2.1 has a reference to SCE1 which appears to be different that the reference to the Delivery Point, which is defined as SP-15?SECTION 2.2 has a reference to to Attachment 1and there is no Attachment 1.SECTION 2.4 (v) was deleted and SECTION 2.4 (vi) was renumbered as SECTION 2.4 (v).SECTIOM 2.4 (v) indicates that the Index Price shall be the Dow Jones Index NP-15; why is this the case when earlier in SECTION 2.1 the Delivery Point is defined as SP-15?  The last sentence indicates a name of "Hanson" which I believe should really be "RCWMD".SECTION 2.5 again has reference to "this SC Agreement", which I believe should be "this Confirmation Letter" or "this Master Agreement".  Also, there is a reference to "RCWMD's usage", shouldn't the terminology in the case of this contract be "production" and "deliveries"?ARTICLE 3SECTION 3.1 should have the following added to the beginning of the sentence "RCWMD".SECTION 3.2 again refers to terminology "energy deliveries and usage" which I believe should be "energy production and deliveries".ARTICLE 4SECTION 4.2 refers to "consumed" which I believe should be "delivered" or "produced".SECTION 4.5 has a reference to Attachment 2 and there is no Attachment 2.  There is again a reference to "receive" and "consume" which should probably be "deliver" and "consume".SECTIOM 4.7 refers to "Term Purchase", which is not a defined term, at least in the Confirmation Letter.  There is also a reference to Exhibit A and there is no Exhibit A; we previously referred to Attachments rather than Exhibits so we need to make sure that we are consistent.ARTICLE 5SECTION 5.1 contains language regarding Scheduling Coordination services, is this fee normal and did you intend for it to be included in this contract.ARTICLE 6SECTION 6.1 contains reference to "this SC Agreement", which I believe should be "this Confirmation Letter" or "this Master Agreement".SECTION 6.2 contains reference to "this Agreement", which I believe should be "this Confirmation Letter" or "this Master Agreement".SECTION 6.6 contains reference to "this Agreement", which I believe should be "this Confirmation Letter" or "this Master Agreement".SECTION 6.8 contains reference to "Schdule ____", which appears to be absent.When you get this e-mail lets talk about the comments.  I would like to have a conference call with Riverside on Wednesday October 31st.Regards,Richard

rogers.herndon@enron.com,rogers.herndon@enron.com,rogers.herndon@enron.com,Subject: ,Rogers,Enron Energy Services, Inc. ("EESI") submitted application to become a NEPO=OL member, to be effective January 1, 2000.  EESI was approved by the NEPOO=L Participants Membership Subcommittee at its January 24, 2000 meeting.  On=e requirement of NEPOOL membership is to satisfy the Financial Assurance Po=licy for NEPOOL Members.  EESI, Enron Energy Marketing Corp, and Enron Powe=r Marketing, Inc. are all members of NEPOOL and have chosen to satisfy the =Financial Assurance Policy by issuance of Performance Bond(s), rather than =corporate guaranty, due to Enron's disagreement with the Form of Corporate =Guaranty required by NEPOOL.EESI, via Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, issued a Performance Bond in th=e amount of $8,000,000 in June 2000; the Performance Bond was reissued in J=une 2001 in the amount of $8,000,000.  EESI received a letter from ISO New =England dated October 10, 2001, addressed to Becky Pitre (EESI Settlements)= and received by Becky probably October 12, 2001, indicating that EESI's cu=rrent Performance Bond was insufficient and that EESI needed to increase th=e amount to $11,703,018.75 to cover EESI's current activity level.  Becky d=elivered the October 10th letter  to my attention whereby I took the letter= to EESI Legal Department (Karen Cordova) and informed Karen that EESI need=ed to increase the Performance Bond to $20,000,000.  Karen requested Credit= Department (Nichole Gunter) initiate an increase in the Performance Bond t=o the $20,000,000 level; to the best of my knowledge the initial conversati=on with Credit Department was October 12, 2001.  In telephone conversations= with ISO-NE, Enron's Credit Department personnel were informed by ISO-NE t=hat in order to avoid Financial Assurance Default the matter needed to be r=esolved within ten (10) days of the date of the October 10, 2001 letter (Oc=tober 19, 2001), however the letter did not indicate such.=20I was notified by Credit Department on October 16, 2001 that the bond compa=ny Enron utilizes for performance bond(s) would not process our Performance= Bond request for increase until Enron paid the bond company for outstandin=g invoices for "other" performance bonds (bond  renewals), approximately $1=50,000.  The "other" performance bond invioces had been bounced around EESI=, since June 2001, to various individuals (i.e. Greg Sharp, Mark Mueller, J=eff Golden, Scott Mills) and had still remained unpaid.  Payments for the "=other" performance bonds were made and the bond company processed our reque=st for increase in the EESI NEPOOL Performance Bond to $20,000,000, which w=as issued by the bond company on October 23, 2001, executed by EESI on Octo=ber 23, 2001 and forwarded via FAX and Overnight Mail to ISO-NE on October =23, 2001.  EESI was unable to comply with the October 19, 2001 deadline to =resolve the Financial Assurance Default due to complications with the bond =company as mentioned above.  Credit Department personnel informed ISO-NE pe=rsonnel that EESI would not meet the October 19, 2001 deadline, but was wor=king diligently to resolve the matter; Credit Department personnel sent via= FAX, a copy of the request to the bond company for revisions to the Perfor=mance Bond to ISO-NE personnel on October 19, 2001. =20I notified Dan Allegretti, (Enron Government Affairs & Chariman, NEPOOL Par=ticipants Committee) of the entire situation prior to October 19, 2001.  Da=n indicated that he did not think there would be any problems, but to get t=he matter resolved as quickly as possible. Dan advised me that the implicat=ions of the Financial Assurance Default would result in communications to t=he Membership Subcommittee and that when the next letter was published, the= following month, EESI would no longer be listed as being in default.  On O=ctober 19, 2001 another letter was sent to Becky Pitre (EESI Settlements) f=rom Edward McKenna, Vice President & Chief Financial Officer informing EESI= that "Enron Energy Services, Inc. has not maintained the required level of= financial assurance for 10 days or more, and has had a total combination o=f 3 financial assurance and/or payment defaults in the last 12 months, whic=h qualifies them as having 2 (two) Level 1 defaults.  The ISO has been in c=ontact with Enron Energy Services, Inc. through multiple telephone communic=ations, and to date the financial assuvance default has not been cured.  Th=erefore, per the established procedure, we are forwarding this information =to the NEPOOL Membership Subcommittee for action by them."  According to Da=n Allegretti the Memberhsip Subcommittee reports to him, as Chariman of the= Members Subcommittee, and he would discuss the issue with them.  The previ=ous two Financial Assurance Defaults mentioned the October 19, 2001 letter =occurred (i) December 2000, when payment was received 1-2 days late and was= automatically resolved when payment was received and (ii) September 2001, =when Financial Assurance Default occurred and was resolved through market a=ctivity.  To the best of my knowledge, EESI was unaware of either the Decem=ber 2000 Payment Default or the September 2001 Financial Assurance Default,= and no information was received by EESI from ISO-NE relative to either inc=idence.According to (i) Protocal for the Initation of Membership Termination Proce=edings and (ii) conversations with Dan Allegretti, the issue should be reso=lved with the receipt on October 24, 2001 of the Performance Bond by ISO-NE=.  I have also advised the ISO-NE, in the future, to send communications to= EESI's Credit Department and not EESI's Settlements.  Also, Dan Allegretti= is investigating the facts leading the the October 19, 2001 letter with re=presentatives from ISO-NE.I left message for Molly Harris as you requested. I was able to speak to De=nise Furey and Nichole Gunter, who both indicated that they would speak wit=h Molly as they all work together. =20Let me know if you need any additional information.Richard =20    =20

d..smith@enron.com,d..smith@enron.com,d..smith@enron.com,Subject: RE: Riverside County Waste Mgt,Mike,The "deal" is between EESI and Riverside County Waste Management Department (RCWMC) is dated April 17, 2000 and the term commenced on Sepetmber 1, 2000 and ending on September 1, 2010.  Based on our bankruptcy filing RCWMD stopped delivery of power on December 6, 2001; RCWMD invoiced EESI for power production for September 2001, 0ctober 2001 and November 2001.  I do not know if they were ever paid by EESI.  I do not know of any invoice for the first six days of December 2001.EESI (myself) and EPMI (Chris Foster) were in the process of renegotiating the above referenced agreement with the plan for EPMI to take over the purchase of power and scheduling services with EESI being the purchaser of the "green tickets"  from EPMI associated with the power production.  There were some major issues to overcome in the renegotiation regarding the "fixed price", "volume committments" and "penalties".  I do not know who, if anyone, is currently looking at this agreement to make any kind of determination EESI's and/or EPMI's desires for the future of this agreement.  RCWMD sent various letters dated December 10, 2001, December 13, 2001, and January 8, 2002 requesting response from EESI.  The December 10, 2001 letter indicates that RCWMD considers the agreement terminated effective December 2, 2001.  I had previously spoke to you about this agreement in December 2001.  It is my opinion that we should not continue this agreement and we should consider RCWMD's offer to terminate the agreement with the exchange of the non-performance panalties for the termination payment.Let me know if you need anything else.Regards,Richard    
d..smith@enron.com,d..smith@enron.com,d..smith@enron.com,Subject: RE: Riverside County Waste Mgt,Mike,The agreement covers multiple projects; to date there is only one project that has come on line.  For the one project that has come on line during the non-performance penalty could be in the range of $150,000 to $640,000, depending on the resoultion of the "effective online date" for said project.  The non-performance penalty was our strongest negotiating point in the ongoing effort to restructure the agreement as there is a potential for penalties for each project for each year of the contract.  The agreement contained some fundamenal flaws in order to be able to book the mark-to-market for the agreement.  I do not have a good handle of the "early termination payment" except to say that there are approxmiately 390,500 MWh's.  The average contract "fixed price" is $33.10 MWh.  I would need to find out what the nine year fixed price from the power curves is to estimate but my best stab would be to estimate the nine year fixed price to be $25.00 MWh which would result in "early termination payment" of approximately $3,200,000 ((390,500*33.10) - (390,500*25.00)).Richard
