However, at the local auction the going price for horses was  so steep that he ended up buying a Donkey instead.  He figured that since he  had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races, and to his  surprise, the Donkey came in third. The  next day the racing form carried this headline, "Preacher's Ass shows". The Preacher was so pleased with the  Donkey that he entered it in the race again, and this time it won.  The next day the form said, "Preacher's Ass, out in front!"The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity, that he ordered the Preacher not to enter the Donkey in another race.  The newspaper printed this headline; "Bishop scratches Preacher's Ass." This was just too much for the Bishop, and he ordered the Preacher to get rid of the animal. The Preacher decided to give it to a Nun in a nearby convent. The headline next day read, "Nun has the best Ass in town." The Bishop fainted. He informed the Nun that she would have to  dispose of the Donkey. She finally found a Farmer who was willing to buy it for $10. Next day the paper said, "Nun peddles her Ass for ten bucks." They buried the Bishop the next day.

I too will never be able to work HARD for a company believing that my best interest are being considered.  Lets all hope, pray, and believe that one day, some day we are better, stronger people for having learned such hard lessons.  I applaud you for your honesty.				Sincere Regards,				Sandra
