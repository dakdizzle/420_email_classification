The compensation would be her current base plus10K. This is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a  manager.Such promotions take place in March and I thinkGwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management(i.e. my and Maureen's procrastination). On unrelated and more serious matter. Gary Hickerson is the primary client for Maureen's services. He communicated to me  a few weeks ago that he is unwilling to underwrite Maureen's position (he is in general unhappy withher contribution). This means that Maureen will have to find another sponsor or leave Enron.Given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal customerwill be quite a challenge.Gary volunteered to pay a very generous severance to Maureen from his budget. I would like to talk to you about it when you have a few minutes.Vince From:	Anne Labbe/ENRON@enronXgate on 05/02/2001 10:34 AMTo:	Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:	 Subject:	Gwen KoepkeVince,Just wanted to touch base with you.  I have tried to contact Maureen so that Gwen's title and salary can be adjusted to manager just as you requested, but have not heard any response from her.  Would you like for me to wait until I hear from Maureen or should I go ahead and proceed in  changing her title?  I just want to make sure that Gwen is in the right peer group during PRC.  Also, I am going to try and set up a meeting with you next week through Shirley to discuss any buring issues that you are experiencing, and your expectations during PRC.Thanks,Anne

You probably remember Krishnafrom his visits to our Bombay office when he was helping you on a few projects.A brief outline of the facts.1. His wife is pregnant. She gave birth to their daughter, Pallavi, a few yearsago after a very complicated pregnancy. Pallavi was a premature child and her survivalwas a miracle (we all thank the Almighty for this wonderful child). Current pregnancyis also very complicated.2. Krishna invited his in-laws to visit and stay with them to care for his wife. The application for a tourist  visa was denied and the reason given for the denial was that they had overstayed theterm of the visa during the previous  visit. The irony is that they complied withthe US laws: they had asked for an extension of the visa and the extension was granted.The company can, of course, intervene on Krishna's behalf. Krishna made an outstanding contribution to Enron (he is currently a VP) and to the American society. I am sure that Ken Lay would have no objections to write a letter on his behalf to the State Department.I would prefer, however, to try informal channels first to avoid confrontationalapproach. It may be better for all the involved in the long-run.I hope you can use your personal contacts to intervene on Krishna'sbehalf and ask for a reversal of the decision on humanitarian grounds. I shall fax to you a copy of the decision.Thanks.Vince

It will help to clarify a few issues. 1. I was contacted by Christian (this means I did not start this phase of the process)    last Friday, as far as I can remember.     Christian expressed interest in joining the Research Group. I told him two things:       a. We would be delighted to have him here.       b. Our mutual relationship and good practices require that he receives           your blessing before we can move ahead.    We agreed to have a conference call Wed morning, your time, with you, Christian and    Mike Roberts.   2. Wednesday call was subsequently cancelled by Christian. Mike and I decided to call you      anyway Thu morning your time, directly, to discuss the matter. I was in a PRC all afternoon and       asked Mike to call you  in case I could not sneak out to join him. Mike called and was      told you were out sick.  3. I am leaving in a few hours for California. I shall be driving back to Houston for the next     3 days. Please, feel free to call Mike an discuss this matter with  him in my absence.  4. I think Christian has a strong preference to be in the Research Group, assuming he moves to     Houston. I think he came to this conclusion after visiting Houston in early July. I did not      bring up the issue of transfer with him at all when he was here.      I can  understand his motivation and think we should take his preferences into account. But the     first  issue is if he can leave Sydney at all. I hope it helps. Cheers.  Vince

I have seen the message from Christian in which he confirmedthat he approached the Research in Houston on his own. He did notreceive any encouragement from me and from Mike. I hope this closes this issue. I can understand Christian's motivation but don't endorse the way he takes to reach his goals.He hopes to accomplish more in a larger group where he can have more interaction with his peerswho have similar backgrounds. I think also that he developed an appreciation for good interpersonal relations in my group he could observe during his stay in Houston. My advice is to try to figure out how to use his skills for Enron and how to develop his socialintelligence.  Vince

We are producing the demand projections fornatural gas by state, by customer class every day. The projectionsare used to forecast AGA storage numbers and have a verygood history of hitting the right number. This validate svery well thedemand model.Getting the supply curve at a specific location is more difficult becauseother regions are competing for the same finite quantity of gasavailable in the short run. We have some good insights into thisproblem as well.My concern is that summer associates are not fully committed to Enron.I have about 7-8 summer associates every year and we always take measuresto keep them away from critical information.Please, let me know how far we can go with Jose.I am ready to help you with baseball.

I treat the Monday meeting as the opportunity to introduce Enron to PredictionCompany and to inform you about Enron's trading operationand especially about our electronic trading platforms.The exchange of information will hopefully lead to future collaboration. We are especially interested in working withyou on improving the algorithms that support our electronic marketmaking functions (automatic adjustments of the price levels and/or bid-offerspreads to the changing market conditions). My group has currentlya research project under way to explore the possibility of taking advantageof some recent developments in the market microstructure theory in our operations.I think that we can definitely collaborate in the energy and other commodity marketsand we can explore other possibilities as well. Given the exploratory characterof the first meeting, it probably makes sense if Prediction Company participation is limited to you and Jim. We shall, of course, be glad to meetwith other associates that you may decide to bring to Houston with you. We shall be alsoglad to visit your company if we both decide to continue our discussions after the first meeting.Enron side will be represented by Greg Whalley,  President & COO of Enron Wholesale Services,and myself. We expect John Lavorato, a member of EWS senior executive team, andmy colleague from London, Dr. Steve Leppard, to join us. Shirley is forwarding the agenda and someadditional information to you tonight.You can reach me over the weekend at my E-mail addres: vkaminski@aol.com or call me at home(281) 367 5377.

The conferenceis tentatively scheduled to take place on February 21 - 22, 2002. Depending on your calendar, theconference organizers can reserve a time slot for your presentation at the conference dinner(February 21, 2002, Thursday) or lunch (February 22, 2002, Friday).This annual conference is devoted to financial engineering in the energy business. The topics coveredin the past meetings  included applications of real options technology to the energy business, risk managementand the future of deregulation. The agenda of the last conference is attached for your review; the agendafor the 2002 event is under development.Given Enron's relationship with UT and our interest in the Energy Finance program, a great source of highly skilled talent for our Analyst / Associate Program, we think that your participationwill benefit the company. The conference is widely attended by senior executives of otherenergy companies and is an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and the agenda for the future.Vince Kaminski

Projects (in the order they suggested it).	1. Prediction Company develops a P&L attribution system (allocation of P&L to different market	factors, like spreads, volume, trader's skills, etc.). Trader's performance evaluation system.	2. Decision support system: a model recommending transactions to a trader without	full trade automation.	3. Fully automated trading system, setting prices and executing trades on an electronic trading platform. II. Financial arrangements. Combination of a number of different forms of equity participation, direct payments    per project on completion, and   fees per transaction.	1. Equity investment would reduce fees and payments. For Prediction Company, this is a preferred form of 	    Enron's participation.	2. Payment per project would look like consulting fees.	3. Next to equity investment, they would like to see a constant income stream through	    fees charged per transaction. My comment: in case they design a decision support	    tool, it will be difficult to come up with a per transaction fee. It will be difficult to identify	    decisions that can be attributed exclusively to their system.Recommendations:	1. A visit to Santa Fe with Kevin Garland to discuss an equity investment.	2. I shall try to dig up more information about the company and the relationship                with UBS.	3. We should  come up with a solution that will help to transfer skills to Enron from	    Prediction Company.

I am still trying to mobilize internal support for the valuation study we discussed at San Antonio. Mark Ruane whom you met, moved onto a new job and his successor is a bit skeptical about the need for a study.Internal Enron  perception is that we understand the process of decision makinginside big  financial institutions (or lack of it), especially in the energy area,regarding valuation of investment projects. Any study would just reveal what wealready understand about quite simplistic tools they use: DCF with a discountrate being subject to negotiations within a very broad band of potentialvalues.It will help if I get the agenda of the conference  soon to pass it on to Jeff Skilling.

Major potential projects (in the order they suggested it).	1. Prediction Company develops a P&L attribution system (allocation of P&L to different market	factors, like spreads, volume, trader's skills, etc.). Trader's performance evaluation system.	2. Decision support system: a model recommending transactions to a trader without	full trade automation.	3. Fully automated trading system, setting prices and executing trades on an electronic trading platform.	Any project would require review of the market data provided by Enron.  (Is it a  free option for them? -  VK) II. Financial arrangements. Combination of a number of different forms of equity participation, direct payments    per project, and   fees per transaction.	1. Equity investment would reduce fees and payments. For Prediction Company, this is a preferred form of 	    Enron's participation.	2. Payment per project that would look like consulting fees. They would like a lump-sum payment	    first (to expand the staff), followed by consulting fees later. 	3. Next to equity investment, they would like to see a constant income stream through	    fees charged per transaction.

I understand thenew plan is to put both the gas and power weather guys at one location.My recommendation is against it. If the objective of having two separate weathergroups is to put in place a system of checks and balances and encourage independent views,the new seating arrangements will nullify it. The power weather guys will defer to Mike who has unquestionable authority and experience.If we go ahead with the new seating arrangements it makes sense to combine the two groupsunder Mike's leadership.Please, let me know what you think.Vince

Before moving to England, he was for many years with the University of  Texas at Austin. He is also an editor of The Journal of Risk and Insurance.Richard expressed interest in coming back to the States, and specifically to Texas. I remember from a number of conversations with you and other rmembers of your staff, that you are thinking about making several additions to the Faculty of Jones School, especially in the area of risk management. Richard is a well qualified candidate that you may consider in your search.I am attaching the address of Richard's CV.

Also, in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor and it's difficult to model the price curves independently: we solve the problem by mappingthem into more liquid and better behaved core  locations curves.We have agreed on the following:1. Winston will investigate the IT side and determine to what extent we can increase the numberof forward price curves that are simulated as basic (core) curves. He will investigate the impact of a largernumber of the core curves on the time required to complete the VaR run.2. The curves associated with the biggest 10-20 positions in each commodity should bemodeled as core curves (i.e. no mapping into other locations). It makes sense to monitorthe biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into  less transparent aggregates.3. The results of an automated clustering (mapping) procedures should be systematicallymonitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions.This responsibility should be vested with one person (right now the responsibility isdispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobodyis responsible). Research can allocate one person to this task;cooperation of trading and RAC will be critical.Vince

For any one of these statio=ns, you can compare all 14 weather forecasts side-by-side either to gain st=atistical confidence in a particular outcome or to quantify the weather ris=k of a specific forecast.  If you rely on weather forecasts, you should be =aware of the extent to which all 14 forecasts agree (or disagree) with each= other. For an example, visit Syncrasy's  Forecast Analysis and Confidence =Trading System (FACTS)?  on our website.   WHICH WEATHER FORECAST IS MORE A=CCURATE?  Discover which weather forecast has been historically the most ac=curate for a particular city over any selected time period (such as last we=ek, month, season, etc.). Refine your analysis with data filters.  For exam=ple, use a filter to determine which of the weather forecasting models is m=ost accurate when actual temperatures are greater than 90 degrees, or when =temperatures change more than 10 degrees within an hour.

Rusty is a very outstanding individual with a very impressive work ethic and interest in topics such as financial engineering and technology, particularly as these issues pertain to the energy industry.   In fact, you met Rusty during your recent visit to Baylor (specifically, last month over dinner at the Gamma Iota Sigma chartering  ceremony).I happen to know that Rusty is already scheduled to visit Enron for an interview for a summer internship on April 19.  He has been invited by Althea Gordon.  If there is any possibility that you could meet with him during his visit, I am sure that he would be most grateful.   Rusty is one of the very best research assistants I have ever had, and I am sure that Enron would benefit from having him aboard during the coming summer. Sincerely,Jim GarvenP.S.: Please find Rusty's resume attached to this email._________________________________________James R.

Rusty is a very outstanding individual with a very impressive work ethic and interest in topics such as financial engineering and technology, particularly as these issues pertain to the energy industry.   In fact, you met Rusty during your recent visit to Baylor (specifically, last month over dinner at the Gamma Iota Sigma chartering  ceremony).I happen to know that Rusty is already scheduled to visit Enron for an interview for a summer internship on April 19.  He has been invited by Althea Gordon.  If there is any possibility that you could meet with him during his visit, I am sure that he would be most grateful.   Rusty is one of the very best research assistants I have ever had, and I am sure that Enron would benefit from having him aboard during the coming summer. Sincerely,Jim GarvenP.S.: Please find Rusty's resume attached to this email._________________________________________James R.

Thegoal is to create a version of Linux that is impervious to outsideattacks.Security Enhanced Linux, or SELinux, is a project under developmentby the NSA to create a version of the operating system that is moresecure than the commercial distributions of Linux available fromsoftware vendors and the open-source community. The PGP Securitydivision of Network Associates is working with the NSA to modify theLinux source code so that applications running on a Linux server orPC have reduced access to a Linux machine's underlying operatingsystem. The aim is to give Linux servers the ability to shirk off"buffer overrun" and "format string" attacks, which take advantage ofloose ends in Linux applications to access a server's core operatingsystem and shut it down. A Linux worm dubbed "Lion" was recentlyidentified as using this method to hack Linux servers.NSA has worked with other software firms to shore up other weaknessesin the operating system. Secure Computing has worked on the SELinuxproject to add its Type Enforcement technology to SELinux. TypeEnforcement protects the operating system and applications bysegmenting them into security "domains" with specifications on whattypes of files can be accessed by each domain. (For example, thiscould be used to prevent access to a configuration file through anapplication, such as Apache Web server). NSA is also working withVMWare to come up with a more secure user permissions system forallowing users with different security access to work on the sameserver.The good news for Linux users who are not high-level NSA operativesis that SELinux will be released to the open-source community oncefinished. This means that commercial Linux vendors could includeSELinux security enhancements in future releases, resulting in morebulletproof Linux Web and database servers in enterprises._______________________________________________________________To contact Phil Hochmuth:Phil Hochmuth is a staff writer for Network World, anda former systems integrator.

These DSM projects can turn a reta=il commodity contract with low profitability into a substantially more prof=itable contract for us.Would one of your GARCH analyses provide us with a quantitative solution?  =One of your experts in differential equations might have devised something.=  We'd really like to have something quantitative if you think it's at all =possible.Thanks,Jeff---------------------- Forwarded by Jeff Gray/HOU/EES on 04/17/2001 12:16 P=M ---------------------------Jeff Gray04/09/2001 04:41 PMTo:=09Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:=09Michael Moore/HOU/EES@EES, Jay Sparling/HOU/EES@EES=20Subject:=09DSM projects as real options  =20Vince:Could you spare a few moments to look over the attached three-page Power Po=int presentation?  At a minimum, we're trying to demonstrate the following:=  In high-volatility electricity environments, for those EES customers who =employ their own capital, their usual capital-project IRR hurdles may be lo=wered slightly in the special case of DSM projects, to allow for the extra =value derived from reduced risk exposure stemming from reduced power consum=ption/dependence.I'm pushing the boundaries of real-option theory (and good sense) and viewi=ng a DSM project as a series of options, the values of which are additive. = First is the option to engage in the DSM project itself; which, if we exer=cise the option immediately, can be valued intrinsically through a simple N=PV analysis.  Second is a strip of put options to generate "negawatts," ext=ending over the useful life of a DSM installation, the cumulative value of =which is an extrinsic value associated with the DSM project.  These options= are exercised sequentially--over the life of the DSM installation--wheneve=r the customer experiences a dramatic, stochastic spike in electricity pric=e, associated with a lognormal price distribution.  I'm calling the value o=f this strip a "residual time value" associated with the original DSM optio=n.  If we can add this residual time value to the NPV and derive a total va=lue that is quantitatively higher than a simple NPV alone,  we may be able =to help the customer get more projects approved, even at the original high =IRR hurdle.Alternatively, and more feasibly, we'd like to give these same customers a ="qualitative" tool with which they can convince their finance gatekeepers t=o lower--for DSM projects--their standard capital-project IRR hurdle .  The= attached presentation is a first attempt at this qualitative argument.We intend to use this only as a sales and marketing tool, to allow at least= one of our customers who has an onerously high hurdle rate to manage aroun=d his company's internal capital-budgeting requirements.  He has set aside =a large sum of money for DSM projects, but will only be able to spend a sma=ll portion of it under his company's current capital budgeting methodology,= which does not take into account forward commodity price volatility.In your opinion, is there any hope in devising a quantitative justification=, or will we have to stick with the qualitative argument as described in th=e attached presentation?  In other words, is it possible to quantify "resid=ual time value" as I've defined it above? Or, even better, are you aware of= a more practical way of conceptualizing this problem?Thanks,Jeff Gray=20=20Vince J Kaminski@ECT01/05/2001 03:26 PMTo:=09Jeff M Gray/NA/Enron@ENRONcc:=09Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alex Huang/=Corp/Enron@ENRON, Gary Hickerson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michelle D Cisneros/HOU/ECT@E=CT=20Subject:=09Power Plant ModelJeff,A few comments on the model:1.

As it turns out, Christian left RAC in April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that they'd only been around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.   From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors (e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.Nelson

We think it would be extremely valuable for Iris to come out to London for a couple weeks to gain a better understanding of the how the models integrate and are truly employed.  I think this would greatly enhance the "product" we'll send to Duffie as well as giving Iris a firm view of Enron Credit.  In addition, she could also explore some of the data sources such as Amadeus and others that might be helpful in private firm modelling.  If we're extremely efficient/lucky in receiving data from D&B or Experian, she might be able to begin analysis on that for the private model efforts.I would recommend she plan on coming out for 2 weeks starting the week of 30 Apr perhaps.  Depending on the progress with the private firm data sources, it probably makes sense to send her back to Houston to work on calibration sets with a likely return visit to London as required.Please let me know your thoughts.Cheers,Scott

A stronger mining play looks like AU.I want to thank you for going to bat for me as much as I hear that you did.  Enron was a company where my skills could be very beneficially used. I regret that we didn't get to scratch the surface of what I could contribute. I feel that beyond being business associates, you and I became good friends. I hope that can remain constant through out the future. The one true question that I would like to pose to you is this. It appears that the political arena here at Enron is currently unfavorable for technical analysis. Without fear of hurting my feeling one way or the other, should I consider having future opportunities with Enron once, if and when, the management situation becomes different?If nothing ever meshs, that does do stop you from contacting me whenever you need Candlestick/technical evaluations.Your good friend,Steve

However, I appreciate you volunteering to potentiallyhaving been on such a round table discussion.I've been teaching a "real options" course that has the students performingmonte carlo analysis, Black-Scholes pricing, and binomial pricing alongwith a heavy dosage of understanding risk neutral pricing.  A few of yournew hires from the undergraduate program will be coming from this course.However, I have a student who will be finishing his MBA next spring that isparticularly good.  He is genuinely interested and curious about optionpricing, trading, and hedging with Excel/VBA skills.  In fact, he usuallyfigures out when I make even very small mistakes in my calculations.This is not to say that some of my other students aren't very talentedthemselves, but that this person really stands out.  Do you think youand/or Enron would be interested in such a person?  If so, what do yourecommend that he do to get his foot in the door?His intention is to finish the MBA, but I do not know if this wouldpreclude you from hiring or at least taking a look at him now.  His name isGeorge Moss and I ordinarily would not bother you directly about apotential employee.  I am making an exception in this case because he is aparticularly good talent without being the slightest bit arrogant.Otherwise, I hope this e-mail finds you doing well and not travelling toomuch.TomProfessor Tom ArnoldE.J.

Let's contact Wharton next week.VinceFrom:	Vasant Shanbhogue/ENRON@enronXgate on 04/25/2001 10:15 AMTo:	Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:	Nelson Neale/NA/Enron@Enron Subject:	Corn Subsidy Govt Program AnalysisHi Vince,	Nelson and I had a meeting yesterday with the Ag Desk folks on how to go forward on the analysis and presentation for this program.  The consensus from the Ag side was that the choice of university will be highly politically driven, ie preferably the university should be from a state that has close ties to sympathetic senators or other political figures.  Also it is preferable if the university faculty have worked on Ag issues before, lending more credibility in the Ag community.  The names that came up were Mississippi State and Texas A&M.  Nelson knows of a person at Mississippi State who worked with the USDA on risk management issues.	The needed analysis itself is not necessarily very deep, and the focus is primarily to get a non-quantitative presentation out that outlines how Enron can take on the downside risk of local crop prices (Enron probably needs to cover actual local prices and not simply an index because I do not think the govt will want to worry about basis risk). 	The pilot program itself will be very small, and lends itself to continuing down the path of short term trading rather than long term origination.  Another thought on hedging our potential short positon (on the origination side) is that the govt program can only provide a partial hedge to the extent of the premium received -- we still have unlimited downside from the short.Vasantp.s. I am writing up Jim Bouillion's project suggestion as a potential project for Wharton.  Of course, we may still ask Wharton for their insights on the corn price protection approach.

vkaminski@aol.com,vkaminski@aol.com,vkaminski@aol.com,Subject: Alliance Info Alert,---------------------- Forwarded by Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT on 04/27/2001 10:46 AM ---------------------------"The Alliance of Energy Suppliers" <alliance@eei.org>@listserver.eei.org on 04/25/2001 10:34:40 AMPlease respond to ntarr@eei.orgSent by:	bounce-app-ippexecs-33275@listserver.eei.orgTo:	"Generation and Power Marketing Executives" <app-ippexecs@listserver.eei.org>cc:	 Subject:	Alliance Info AlertDear Generation/Power Marketing Executive:The following is this week's Alliance Express newsletter, and a special announcement regarding a proposed action by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).FASB 133FASB is considering an exception to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133 that will exempt energy companies from the requirement to account for capacity contracts as derivatives.  A vote against the exception would result in a significant increase in earnings volatility, and raises other important concerns for energy suppliers.  (Attached is a summary of this issue.)  The Board is expected to vote on this issue during May 2001.  EEI will be taking steps to appraise FASB of our concerns.  If you, or company CFO would like more information about this effort, please contact Richard McMahon, Executive Director of the Alliance of Energy Suppliers, at rmcmahon@eei.org, or at 202-508-5571.                             Alliance of Energy Suppliers Express?April 25, 2001INSIDE WASHINGTONFEDERAL AFFAIRS***Bill Repealing PUHCA Is Approved By Senate Committee***The Senate Banking Committee today approved S 206, a bill that repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.  The bill would repeal PUHCA and transfer oversight of public utility holding companies from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and appropriate state agencies.S.206 was approved with two amendments.  Offered by Sen. Mike Enzi (R-WY), the first amendment would establish the Electric Energy Market Competition Task Force to study competition in the wholesale and retail market for electric energy in the United States. The task force would be made up of representatives of FERC, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, as well as non-voting representatives from the Department of Agriculture and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The amendment also contained a provision, co-sponsored by Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), that would preserve FERC's authority to require that energy rates are reasonable and do not include the pass-through of holding company costs that are unrelated to energy.Another amendment, offered by Sen. Jon Corzine (D-NJ), initiated a study by the General Accounting Office of the success of federal and state governments in preventing anticompetitive practices by public utility holding companies and in promoting competition and efficient energy markets. ***Institute?s Tax Agreement With Public Power Again Introduced on Hill***The tax agreement EEI reached with the American Public Power Association (APPA) and the Large Public Power Council (LPPC) again has been introduced in the House.  The bill (HR 1459) contains the same provisions as were in a measure (HR 4971), with technical corrections, introduced during the 106th Congress.  HR 1459 was introduced by Rep. J.D. Hayworth (R-AZ) and nine original co-sponsors from the Ways and Means Committee.HR 1459 contains four key provisions with tax code changes:  1) The tax-free sale or spin-off of transmission assets into an RTO is allowed, 2) Nuclear decommissioning laws are adapted to a competitive market by allowing deductions to a trust fund no longer subject to cost-of service ratemaking, 3) The contributions in aid of construction (CIAC) tax on interconnections to transmission and distribution facilities is eliminated, and 4) Private use tax rules are changed to permit open access to transmission and distribution facilities.The measure was referred to the House Ways and Means Committee, and EEI has urged Congress to act without delay in moving it forward.  Enactment will help encourage a vigorous but fair competitive environment, the Institute noted.  The same legislation has been incorporated into S 389, Senate Energy Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski's (R-AK) energy security bill, and stand-alone legislation could also be introduced.  Hearings are expected to be held in both the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees, probably after consideration of President Bush's individual tax proposal. ADMINISTRATION/FERC***White House Seeks $2 Trillion Budget In Fiscal Year 2002***President Bush last week transmitted a $2 trillion fiscal year 2002 budget request to Capitol Hill.  The Administration noted that its proposal *moderates recent explosive growth in discretionary spending to four percent in 2002,* an increase of $26 billion over the preceding fiscal year.  The budget bid contains a $231 billion total surplus in 2002, and projects a $5.6 trillion surplus over the next ten years.In the energy area, the Administration noted the federal government?s *longstanding and evolving role* in the sector, pointing out that most federal energy programs and agencies have no state or private counterparts.  It proposed about $2.8 billion in discretionary spending for energy programs, and about $2.1 billion in tax benefits, *mainly to encourage development of traditional and alternative energy sources.*  DOE?s budget request was $19.2 billion, including $2.3 billion for energy resources programs.  This later figure represents a decrease of $196 million, or 7.9 percent, from fiscal year 2001.In the environmental sector, the Administration sought some $7.3 billion in discretionary funding for EPA, including a $3.7 billion operating program focused on implementation of most federal pollution control laws. ***Success of Restructuring Tied to Energy Strategy, FERC?s Massey Asserts***Electric restructuring may be in jeopardy, and its success *is in the hands of regulators and policymakers,* FERC Commissioner William Massey has asserted.  Speaking at a recent National Governors Association policy forum in Philadelphia, Commissioner Massey urged officials to pay attention to the key elements of a national energy strategy.First, he specified, there is a need for an adequate supply of the energy commodity.  Turning to a second element, Commissioner Massey told forum attendees that *all the supply in the world won?t help unless it can be delivered over an adequate, efficient, non-discriminatory network.*  Commissioner Massey identified market structure as the third essential element of a national energy strategy, while citing an inherent difficulty: that *good structure cannot be easily parsed between wholesale and retail jurisdictions.*  Accordingly, he said, FERC and the states must work together on market structure.The final element of a successful energy strategy, the commissioner specified, is the need for aggressive FERC intervention when markets fail to do their job.  *If the states cannot depend on the wholesale market regulator to ensure reasonable prices for consumers,* he cautioned, they *will surely think twice before heading down the restructuring path.*NEW GENERATION***Dynegy To Build Second Plant in Kentucky***Dynegy has announced plans to construct a new 330 megawatt plant adjacent to the Riverside Generating project in Lawrence County, Kentucky.  Dynegy will sell the power generated at the plant in the wholesale market.  Commercial operation is expected to begin first quarter of 2002.***PPL To Expand Generation Capacity***PPL Corporation this week said it would build a 540 megawatt power plant near Chicago and would increase the capacity of its Susquehanna nuclear plant by 100 megawatts.  CEO William Hecht said the Illinois plant is expected to be in service by the summer of 2002.***Constellation Energy Group Announces Eight New Plants***Constellation Energy Group  this week announced that the company is scheduled to bring four peaking power plants on line this summer.  Additionally, four larger power plants are scheduled to enter service in the following two summers.   The four peaking plants are located in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia.  The larger power plants are under construction in California, Florida, Illinois, and Texas.*We?re building in these seven states because they serve regions where wholesale electricity is needed and where we can provide energy to support our national power marketing business,* said Constellation Energy Group Chairman and CEO Christian Poindexter.***California Energy Commission Approves Construction of Otay Mesa Generating Plant***PG&E Corporation?s National Energy Group (NEG) last week announced that the California Energy Commission (CEC) has approved construction of the Otay Mesa Generating Plant in San Diego County, which the NEG has developed.  The 500 megawatt project will produce enough electricity to power about 1,000 homes.  After the development process is completed, Calpine Corporation will assume ownership of the project and will construct and operate the plant.  NEG will contract for up to half the plants output.ENERGY DATA*** Weekly Electric Output (Week 15)***Electric output reached 63,528 GWh for the week ending April 14 (Week 15), with the highest increase over 2000 levels in the South Central states, which both had a 12.6 percent increase over 2000 for week 15.  Year-to-date, the Rocky Mountain region experienced the greatest increase in output (7.6 percent) over 2000.

I'll discuss it with Mike and Eric this morning.  Also agree that we'll almost assuredly save money in the long run by building a more robust model off more comprehensive data to start with.Cheers,ScottAmitava Dhar26/04/2001 21:23To:	Mike Mumford/LON/ECT@ECT, Eric Kirkpatrick/EU/Enron@Enron, Scott Salmon/EU/Enron@Enroncc:	Iris Mack/ENRON@enronXgate, Vasant Shanbhogue/Enron@EnronXGate, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Craig Chaney/Enron@EnronXGate Subject:	Short Term Private Firm Model: Static historical snapshot+performance data for model developmentMike, Scott, Eric,After brainstorming and discussing further on data here, we think that our final specifications for modelling data requirement need to be as follows:We need bankrupt, default and nondefault (which covers nonbankrupt) accounts with 4 quarterly observation snapshots and 12 months performance following the latest snapshot.  Monthly performance indicator need to be available for the entire 12 months performance period.  We will need all the bankrupt and default accounts and comparable sample of good accounts with weights.For the purpose of model validation, we will need data with above specs covering 16 months of performance.  This means that we will need rolling (4 quarterly snapshots + 12 months performance) data for 4 monthly shifts:Input snapshots											Performance1999 March end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end, 1999 December end			12 month end performance for Jan 2000 through Dec 20001999 Feb end, 1999 May end, 1999 August end, 1999 November end				12 month end performance for Dec 1999 through Nov 20001999 Jan end, 1999 Apr end, 1999 July end, 1999 October end					12 month end performance for Nov 1999 through Oct 20001998 December end, 1999 Mar end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end				12 month end performance for Oct 1999 through Sep 2000We will need bankruptcy chapterwise indicator, if available during the performance period.  Our definition of default is either bankruptcy or 90+ days delinquency on any trade credit.We have also discussed the cost aspect and we think considering the big picture, it makes sense to spend  the extra amount to get the right data for analysis.Please let me know your thoughts.  This will require D&B to give us a modified quote and we could possibly move forward quickly.Regards,Amitava<Embedded StdOleLink>

I really want to reinitiate the conversations MarketPoint was havingwith John Goodpasture and you, and he said either or both of you were theright people to continue after his responsibility shift.  John was quitepositive about the idea of Enron acquiring MarketPoint NARG through license,and he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in thatdirection after he handed it to you.Would this coming Tuesday morning at 930 am be a good time for you guys?  Ifso, please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message onmy voicemail at (650)218-3069.  I think you will be truly impressed with thescope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run NARGand the long run NARG in which you were interested (not to mention our powermodel).  The progress is noticeable since you saw it.  Both long and shortterm NARG are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at themoment ranging from Venezuelan LNG, North American LNG import terminals andterm, gas basis calculations, trading support, power plant development,gas-to-power price spreads in key markets, veracity of heat rate trades,bank financings, storage field evaluation, and which new pipelines we canexpect to see enter and which are dogs.I really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutuallyproductive direction again.  I think NARG can help you become even moresuccessful, and I look forward to working with you.We have a new office address and new phone number as well.

I do not think he would be appropriate for Bryan's group -- he needs a person who tracks market developments and understands fundamental data, and although this guy may be good at modeling, we already have Iris and Amitava doing the modeling and looking at data.  At this stage, I would prefer to hire somebody with direct experience in credit analysis (banking, rating agency).  I am worried that if we get another person without data analysis experience, then Amitava will find himself with two people (Iris being the other one) who are both inexperienced in this area, and he will find himself doing a lot of the work anyway.	If you want to pursue him, we should probably do a phone interview first.Vasant

I didn't think any of them would be invited to the dinner, and probably none will even come to the presentation.  The invitation did elicit one request for the final report though, so maybe it wasn't a complete waste.  I didn't realize that the dinner had turned into a box visit.  that sounds great.

How would you plan on using him?  My only concern about using a summer intern would be that I would not want him to learn all about Enron's operations in power trading and then go work somewhere else.  But if you think we can use him in a more generic manner where you give him specialized projects and you yourself deal directly with the traders, then that may be a possibility.  If you agree, let us check with Vince and then interview him.Vasant

The firstis introduction of  new members of the Research Group, and of the associates andsummer interns  rotating through the group. The second objective is to reviewinteresting  publications related to energy markets, quantitative finance andother topics  of interest to the Enron audience. I have run out of the newmembers to  introduce and it's time to some real work. Today's column is devoted to the issue of technicalanalysis. Financial  economists tend to dismiss technical analysis (chartism) asvoodoo science.  Over the last few years, however, a significant amount ofevidence that  technical analysis works at least in some markets. A paperpublished recently  by Carol Osler of Federal Reserve Bank of New York (CurrencyOrders and  Exchange-Rate Dynamics: Explaining the Success of Technical Analysis)reviews  two cases in which technical analysis proved quite successful inoffering  useful predictions in the foreign currency markets. The firstprediction is  that trends tend to be reversed at identifiable support orresistance levels.  The second is that if a support or resistance level isbreached, trends tend  to accelerate. The explanation of this success can be found, according toCarol Osler, in the  microstructure of the F/X market: take-profit and stop-lossorders tend to  cluster around certain typical levels (like exchange rate endingin a specific  market at 00 or 50 level). For example, the author found thatthat roughly  2.8% of all stop-loss buy orders are triggered when the rate hitsa round  number, while 10.5% of take profit sales orders are triggered. Thisasymmetry  explains the success of the first prediction of technical analysis. Asecond  asymmetry is related to clustering of orders just above and just belowround  numbers ending in 50 and 00. Stop-loss buy orders are infrequent at ratesjust  below these levels, and cluster above these levels. Stop-loss sell  orders,however, cluster just below 00 and 50 levels a relatively scarce at  rates justabove these levels.  The question remains, why conditional orders tend tocluster at certain  levels. One possibility is cognitive advantage tradersderive from managing  large volume of information using simplified rules.Another possibility is  that they follow recommendations of technical analysisin managing their  books. In this case, technical analysis becomes aself-fulfilling prophecy. Please, contact us for thecopy of the paper if this caught your attention. - wjk0506.doc

I found our discussions both informative and stimulating.    Vince, I was genuinely impressed by the caliber of the group you haveassembled at Enron.  Their individual and collective expertise is obvious;and they were most generous in exchanging ideas and sharing opinions with me.    If you or any of your people have, over the weekend, developed furtherquestions or thought of additional information that might be helpful, I'mstanding by.  I'm eager to continue our dialogue.

S&P Credit Indices are quoted in basis                  points over the U.S. Treasury yield curve once daily.                   Credit spread movements within the investment grade spectrum are                  represented in the S&P U.S. Industrial Investment Grade Credit Index while                  movements within the speculative grade rating spectrum are captured in the                  S&P U.S. Industrial Speculative Grade Credit Index.                   Each credit index represents the distribution of U.S. corporate issues across                  different rating categories and subsectors. Re-balancing occurs regularly to                  ensure that the indices are composed of relevant issues with sufficient                  liquidity. Pricing information for the S&P Credit Indices' underlying securities                  is derived from a number of sources.                   Option adjusted spreads (OAS) are used as a proxy for nominal credit                  spreads in order to adjust for the presence of embedded options. Standard &                  Poor's utilizes the proprietary option adjusted spread model developed by                  Andrew Kalotay Associates, Inc.

vkaminski@aol.com,vkaminski@aol.com,vkaminski@aol.com,Subject: Var Issues,A few comments on the state of our VaR models. The issues always become morecontroversial during the periods when vols and positions increase and I wouldlike to share with you a few observations.1. Critical importance of a  good risk management system toEnron (and the P/E ratio).A number of recent analysts' reports characterized Enron as a hedge fund engaged inmassive directional trading and representing huge risks to investors. One way to counter thiscrirticism is to emphasize the quality of Enron's risk amnageemnt system andour strong risk amangeemnt culture.  Our claims regarding the strong risk managementtechnology and culture should be, however, supported  by reality.It is critical that we continue to improve our risk management systems and also canconvince the external parties (stock analysts, creditors,  credit rating agencies) aboutthe quality of our financial technology. This can be done through targeted disclosure of the elements of our technology, as we have done frequently in the past.by reality.2. Inputs from the trading desks vs. historical calibration.The VaR system used in Enron is based on the assumption that as much inputinformation as possible should come from the market (i.e. trading desks), or should be calibrated tothe market observations (as opposed to historical data).One immediate improvement: we should review inputs that are not based on the trading desksinformation and move, if possible, to replace them with market based, forward looking data.One should not assume, of course, that the information coming from thetrading desks is perfect. One problem that is persistent in some portfolios is the disconnectbetween the posted forward vols curves and subsequent fluctuations in the forward prices curves. The forward vols curves should be relatively unbiased expectations of future realized forward price volati;oty. If this is not the case, back testing for some portfolios will systematically fail. One way to address the problem is to implement a module that compares systematicallyfwd vols posted by the trading desks with subsequent price movements. It will allow us to identify the source of problems we see in some books.3. VaR process management.Given the size of our trading operation, we are running a VaR factory,a system designed to produce timely risk assessment for all the portfolios.What is missing is the industrial type process that guarantees the qualityof the results.Specifically, I am concerned about absence of one person vested with the responsibilityfor the model calibration. Right now this responsibility is dispersed in the organizationand resides somewhere between the IT, RAC and Research. As a result we haveinputs updated inconsistently and without proper quality controls. Some inputs used currently in the system are 2 years old.Another aspect of this problem is prioritization of different projects. In my view some recent modification to the system tied up IT resources and were of marginalusefulness (and in some case on questionableunderstanding of mathematics). Of course, I can be wrong but there is was no systematic process tobring these issues to the table, in a meeting involving all the concerned partiesand
