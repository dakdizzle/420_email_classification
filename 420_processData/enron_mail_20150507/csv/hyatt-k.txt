eric.gadd@enron.com,eric.gadd@enron.com,eric.gadd@enron.com,Subject: TW lateral pipe sale,TW currently owns a section of pipe called the Gomez lateral located south of TW's West Texas #2 compressor station.  The lateral is approximately 35 miles long and is a 20-inch diameter pipeline.The Gomez lateral is currently not in service and is filled with sweet gas.  Per Field Operations personnel, the last time the line was used was October 31, 2000.  Pioneer Gas Pipeline is an intratstate gathering and transmission company.  Pioneer has expressed a written interest in acquiring the lateral from TW for $2 million.  Current book value on the line is ______________ .TW could file with FERC for abandonment of the pipe (and sale) under the existing blanket authority if:	1) no IT gas has flowed for the 12 months prior to effective date of the sale or;	2) no FT shipper has a firm receipt or delivery point on the lateral for the 12 months prior...If an FT shipper does have a valid contract on the lateral, then we would need to get the shipper to amend his contract to effectuate the sale.Items to Verify: 1) Identify any entity currently having firm receipt or delivery rights on the Gomez lateral 2) Determine volume of gas in pipe and associated value for sale (field ops is checking)Opportunities for TW:By Pioneer puchasing and integrating the lateral into their system, they can effectuate incremental supply deliveries into TW.  This would reduce the amount of gas necessary for TW to transport south of WT-2 (via displacement) and make more supply available for deliveries going west.A lunch has been scheduled with Phil Allard from Pioneer on Wednesday 2/20 if you would like to attend.

jima@pandaenergy.com,jima@pandaenergy.com,jima@pandaenergy.com,Subject: FW: Article on Sonoran Project, Development of Sonoran Pipeline Project Halted02/15/2002 PR Newswire (Copyright (c) 2002, PR Newswire) HOUSTON, Feb. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: KMP) and Calpine Corporation (NYSE: CPN) today announced the termination of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline project. The Sonoran Pipeline was unable to secure sufficient binding commitments to make a successful project given market conditions. Securing firm transportation agreements was a stipulation that executives of both companies initially stated was necessary before development of the project could begin. Neither company has spent significant dollars on the proposed development of the pipeline and it was not expected to begin service until 2004. Both KMP and Calpine will continue to evaluate other opportunities to serve the growing California market. Phase I of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline would have extended from the Blanco Hub and terminated near Needles and Topock, Calif., with the possibility of a second phase extending into northern California. Based in San Jose, Calif., Calpine Corporation is an independent power company that is dedicated to providing customers with clean, efficient, natural gas-fired power generation. It generates and markets power, through plants it develops, owns and operates, in 29 states in the United States, three provinces in Canada and in the United Kingdom. Calpine also is the world's largest producer of renewable geothermal energy, and it owns 1.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved natural gas reserves in Canada and the United States. The company was founded in 1984 and is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPN. For more information about Calpine, visit its website at www.calpine.com . Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L. P. is the nation's largest pipeline master limited partnership with an enterprise value of approximately $9 billion. KMP owns and operates more than 20,000 miles of pipelines and over 70 terminals. Its pipelines transport more than two million barrels per day of gasoline and other petroleum products and up to 4.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. Its terminals handle over 50 million tons of coal and other bulk materials annually and have a liquids storage capacity of more than 53 million barrels for petroleum products and chemicals. KMP is also the leading provider in the U.S. of CO2, which is used in enhanced oil recovery projects.

KIRK: To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.DR. TIMOTHY LEARY: Because that's the only trip the establishment would letit take.SADDAM HUSSEIN: This was an unprovoked act of rebellion. We were justifiedin dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.RONALD REAGAN: I forgot.HIPPOCRATES: Because of an excess of phlegm in its pancreas.ANDERSEN CONSULTING: Deregulation of the chicken's side of the road was athreatening dominant market position. The chicken was faced withsignificant challenges to create and develop the competencies required forthe newly competitive market.  Andersen Consulting, in a partneringrelationship with the client, helped the chicken by rethinking its physicaldistribution strategy and implementation processes. Using the PoultryIntegration Model(PIM),Andersen helped the chicken use its skills, methodologies, knowledge,capital and experiences to align the chicken's people, processes andtechnology in support of its overall strategy within a Program Managementframework.Andersen Consulting convened a diverse cross-spectrum of road analysts andbest chickens along with Anderson consultants with deep skills in thetransportation industry to engage in a two-day itinerary of meetings inorder to leverage their personal knowledge capital, both tacit and explicit,and to enable them to synergize with each other in order to achieve theimplicit goals of delivering and successfully architecting and implementingan enterprise-wide value framework across the continuum of poultrycross-median processes. The meeting was held in a park-like setting,enabling and creating an impactful environment which was strategicallybased, industry-focused, and built upon a consistent, clear and unifiedmarket message and aligned with the chicken's mission,vision, and corevalues.  This was conducive towards the creation of a total businessintegration solution. In summary, Andersen Consulting helped the chickenmanage change to become more successful.LOUIS FARRAKHAN: The road, you see, represents the black man. The chickencrossed the black man in order to trample him and keep him down.DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.: I envision a world where all chickens will befree to cross roads without having their motives called into question.MOSES: And God came down from the Heavens, and He said unto the chicken,"Thou shalt cross the road." And the chicken crossed the road, and therewas much rejoicing.FOX MULDER: You saw it cross the road with your own Eyes. How many morechickens have to cross the road before you believe it?RICHARD NIXON: The chicken did not cross the road. I repeat, the chicken didNOT cross the road.MACHIAVELLI: The point is that the chicken crossed the road. Who cares why?The end of crossing the road justifies whatever motive there was.JERRY SEINFELD: Why does anyone cross a road? I mean, why doesn't anyoneever think to ask, "What the heck was this chicken doing walking aroundall over the place, anyway?"SIGMUND FREUD: The fact that you are at all concerned that the chickencrossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.BILL GATES: I will soon release the new Chicken Office 2002, which will notonly cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, andbalance your checkbook.OLIVER STONE: The question is not, "Why did the chicken cross the road?"Rather, it is, "Who was crossing the road at the same time, whom weoverlooked in our haste to observe the chicken crossing?"CHARLES DARWIN: Chickens, over great periods of time, have been naturallyselected and evolved over time in such a way that they are now geneticallyendowed with the capabilities required to cross roads.ALBERT EINSTEIN: Whether the chicken crossed the road or the road movedbeneath the chicken depends upon your frame of reference.BUDDHA: Asking this question denies your own chicken nature.RALPH WALDO EMERSON: The chicken did not cross the road. It transcended it.COLONEL SANDERS: I missed one.BILL CLINTON : I did not, repeat, did not have sexual relations with thechicken.

If the Kern volume of 700,000 (out of 900,000 capacity) doesn't go to Calif end-users, I think Mojave will have a somewhat stranded segment from Cal border to the Kern interconnect.  We could then take this gas and haul it to Phoenix.  Let me know what you thinkkh

The sale not only helps WPL's current finances but eliminates the need to spend $1.2bn on the expansion.  What's interesting is the preferred shares also established in the deal.

Never take a beer to a job interview2. Always identify people in your yard before shooting at them.3. It's considered tacky to take a cooler to church.4. If you have to vacuum the bed, it is time to change the sheets.5. Even if you're certain that you are included in the will, it isstill considered rude to drive the U-Haul to the funeral home.DINING OUT:1. When decanting wine from the box, make sure that you tilt thepaper cup and pour slowly so as not to "bruise" the fruit of the vine.2. If drinking directly from the bottle, always hold it with your hands.ENTERTAINING IN YOUR HOME:1. A centerpiece for the table should never be anything preparedby a taxidermist.2. Do not allow the dog to eat at the table, no matter how goodhis manners are.PERSONAL HYGIENE:1. While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this is a job thatshould done in private, using one's OWN truck keys.2. Even if you live alone, deodorant is not a waste of good money.3. Use of proper toiletries can only delay bathing for a few days.4. Dirt and grease under the fingernails is a social no-no, as they tendto detract from a woman's jewelry and alter the taste of finger foods.DATING (Outside the Family):1. Always offer to bait your date's hook, especially on the first date.2. Be assertive, let her know you're interested: "I've been wanting togo out with you since I read that stuff on the bathroom wall two years ago".3. Establish, with her parents what time, she is expected back.Some will say 10:00 PM., others might say "Monday." If the latter isthe answer, it is the man's responsibility to get her to school on time.THEATER ETIQUETTE:1. Crying babies should be taken to the lobby and picked upimmediately after the movie has ended.2. Refrain from talking to characters on the screen. Tests haveproven they can't hear you.WEDDINGS:1. Livestock, usually, is a poor choice for a wedding gift.2. Kissing the bride for more than 5 seconds may get you shot.3. For the groom, at least, rent a tux. A leisure suit with a cummerbundand a clean bowling shirt can create a tacky appearance.4. Though uncomfortable, say "yes" to socks and shoes for thatspecial occasion.DRIVING ETIQUETTE:1. Dim your headlights for approaching vehicles, even if the gunis loaded and the deer is in sight.2. When approaching a four-way stop, the vehicle with the largesttires does not always have the right of way.3. Never tow another car using panty hose and duct tape.4.

Electric Pwr Conf - Natural Gas Infrastructure Committee,Electric Pwr Conf - Natural Gas Infrastructure Committee,Electric Pwr Conf - Natural Gas Infrastructure Committee,Cc: carries@tradefairgroup.com,Hi everyone!!	For those of you I haven't met personnally, my name is Kevin Hyatt.  I am currently chairing the Natural Gas Infrastructure subcommittee for the Electric Power Conference 2002 to be held in March.  You are receiving this email because you have previously expressed an interest in serving on the committee.  Attached below is the current subcommittee track agenda with the 4 sessions and each session's speaking topics.  The track and topics were developed over the last 3 months with various inputs from committee members and the Trade Fair Group staff.Our current challenge is finding speakers for items 1, 6, and 15 (highlighted in red).  If you move your cursor over the topic, the comment box will appear outlining in a little better detail what info we are trying to present for the conference attendees.  I am working on lining up several speakers but as of yet have only confirmed one from Calpine.  What I need each of you to do is review the agenda, think about who you may know who would be a good speaker for the topic, then call them to see if they are interested.  Speeches should last no more than 30 minutes with a Q&A period afterward.  If possible, please email or call me with your results by Friday 10/26.  Interested speakers will receive a formal invitation from the Trade Fair Group confirming their attendance.    Thanks for your help.  Don't hesitate to call me (713-853-5559) or Carrie Shapiro (713-463-9595 x307) with any questions!!

Sources indicate their project is still moving forward but is having "marketing issues".ROW - A large diameter water line that serves Palo Verde runs from West Phoenix to the nuclear plant.  One thought was to use the ROW to install the gas line and reach the new generation plants in the area.   However, AZ Public Service indicated that the water line is constantly being replaced due to corrosion and repair work may interfere with any other line in the same easement.Cost estimate - Current fully-loaded cost estimate (including interest, overheads, ROW, etc.) is $680mm based on a reduced scale project of 500,000 MMBtu/d capacity to Phoenix.  Various deal structures are being analyzed to present several pricing options to the market.  Likely minimum term will be 20 years based on the cost.Marketing -	Duke - Met 10/25.

The conference will be held in St. Louis, MO March 19-21, 2002.  Website is www.electricpowerexpo.com/ep2002/cfp.html.  Primary attendees are electric power plant developers, builders, operators, and equipment suppliers.One of our proposed speaking topics is "LNG - a new role in North American supply." A concern among power generators has been the lack of domestic gas supply and pipeline infrastructure to serve growing gas-fired electric generation needs.  The Committee feels LNG can and will play a more a prominent supply role in the near future.I'm looking for an LNG expert who would be willing to give a 15-30 minute presentation on the morning of March 20, 2002, 10 - 11:30am.  They would be speaking with 2-3 other presenters and then participate in a Q&A session afterward.  After you visit the website, if could let me know if you are interested in speaking, I will have a formal invitation forwarded to you. Thanks for the help!Kevin Hyatt713-853-5559kevin.hyatt@enron.com

eric.gadd@enron.com,eric.gadd@enron.com,eric.gadd@enron.com,Subject: Az Public Service update on Sun Devil,I just spoke with Curt Brechtel from APS this morning.  I had called him last week asking for feedback related to our latest Sun Devil offer to them.  He reviewed our offer with Tom Carlson.  Tom has 2 issues (listed by priority):1) Enron credit rating and where the pipelines stand with the current financial situation.	Do we have a timeline wherein the pipes (specifically TW) will have its own credit rating?2) Full requirements contract settlement at FERC	APS still has no idea where this process will lead as far as their volume requirements are concerned.  APS is still comfortable committing 100,000 MMBtu/d to Sun Devil, but likely not the 200,000 we asked for (though 100,000 with an option to increase is a possibility).

If so, when?Should we get Rod Hayslett / Stan on the phone with their finance people?Please advise asap so I can put an action plan together.  Thanks for the help.khyatt

bardblack@aol.com,bardblack@aol.com,bardblack@aol.com,Subject: RE: FW: Viagra Contest,it likely won't survive as Enron (due to the stigma), they'll rename it something that better fits a pipeline business restructured as some kind of master limited partnership.  Things are OK, some days are worse than others.  I'm still trying to develop new gas pipeline business in the west, but it's hard without a lot of loose cash lying around.
