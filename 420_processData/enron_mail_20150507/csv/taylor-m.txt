The fax is 323-208-924 or 911.These numbers must be preceded by the correct "Ocean Code."From 9/4 to 9/6 the full number to dial is 011-874-323-208-910 (using the Atlantic West code).From 9/7 to 9/9 it will be 011-871-323-208-910 (using the Atlantic East code).I'm told that if you dial the wrong code you'll get a recording telling you which code to use.It is also possible to call person-to-person by calling the local operator and asking for the INMARSAT operator.  You will need to give the INMARSAT operator the name of the ship, the guest's name and the closest land position.Apparently it will also be possible to send and receive e-mails but the procedure remains unclear.Mark TaylorVice President and General CounselEnron Wholesale Services(713)853-7459

It might be a good idea to try and get the ISDA team to spend a little time on non-financial commodities.  It's not clear from this summary that they intend to raise energy commodity derivatives as an issue or attempt to achieve parity of legal treatment with bank products.  Just so you know, we have run into this kind of blind spot from local participants (who are mostly banks and investment firms) before but the New York ISDA staff is usually willing to help us out.

dhudanish@brobeck.com,dhudanish@brobeck.com,dhudanish@brobeck.com,Subject: RE:,David,Thanks for your note.  Glad to hear you and yours are well.  We docked in Southampton on Monday morning so I was already in our London office on Tuesday and just back from lunch when the news started coming through.  I was traveling with a couple of friends from NYC (Amanda McGovern, Noble Black's UVA classmate, and Linda Hayman, her mom and a friend of mine from my Skadden days) so it was rather tense for a while as we tried to find their friends but everyone came through pretty well.  Our return had been scheduled for Wednesday of that week so of course we were stranded in London but made it back Sunday.  Not that we were having much fun, but there were worse places to be stranded.  I felt bad for the QE2 passengers on their way from Southampton to NYC.  They would have gotten the news on their first day at sea and had to spend what should have been a pleasant cruise thinking about events and worrying.I've heard good things from both Anne and Brad about your meeting here in Houston.  Thanks for getting into that.  It sounds like exactly what we needed.  I have been talking to Barbara and she will check with Frank concerning the letter.I'll look forward to chatting sometime soon so I can hear what's been happening with you and how you are coping.  Hope it is all going as smoothly as possible.  Linda tells me that New York is a changed place -- nearly empty evenings and weekends.Mark

I have always assumed that they were primarily for the benefit of the brokers.  Of course, in the U.S. they are probably required by the SEC and in a country where they are not required you have to wonder how well the brokers are being policed by regulators.  I guess it makes sense to at least contact local counsel to find out what protections there are for the customer and whether or not it would be reasonable to ask for something in writing.  I don't think we need written opinions of counsel.  It might also make sense to explain to the business folks that we think there is incrementally greater legal risk in using those arrangements and that while they may be permitted to use them they should keep activities to a minimum where there is a more secure alternative.Sorry for rambling.Mark

I think his company is now called American Century and he is still managing international mutual funds.I was in Monmouth last weekend for homecoming.  Dahlquist, McGehee, McCabe, Perschke, Vance and Ehrenhart were there.  Ehrenhart actually has a son who is a freshman at Monmouth and has joined ZBT.  Hope you guys are doing well.Mark

VICTORIA ISLAND.LAGOS.BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPI am NURA USMAN, a management consultant in the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), I am a member of the Tenders Board a Committee in charge of Contract Awards and Payment Approvals (C A P A). I got your contact during my quest for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign accountThere were series of contracts executed by a consortium of Multinationals in the oil industry in favor of the (DPR) among which were;1) The expansion of Pipeline network within Nigeria for crude oil anddownstream products distribution and subsequent evacuation. - USD$2 Billion.2) Contract for Turn around Maintenance (TAM) at the various Refineries in the country.3) The construction of Storage Tanks for Petroleum Product (Depots) -USD$94 Million.The original value of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the tune of Thirty Six million, Five Hundred and sixty one thousand United States Dollars (USD$36,561,000.00) which has recently been approved and now ready to be transferred. However the companies that actually executed the aforementioned contract have been fully paid and the project officially commissioned.Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening and/ or operating foreign accounts in our names.Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed amongst ourselves to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for any incidental expenses during the course of this transaction, you will then be mandated to revert the balance 70% to us in due course, or as will be advised in due course.You must however NOTE that this transaction is subject to the followingterms and conditions; Our conviction of your transparent honesty anddiligence, that you must accord this transaction with utmost confidentiality and secrecy.Modalities have been worked out at the highest levels of the Ministry ofFinance, Central Bank of Nigeria and the Presidential Task Force on Contract Payment for the immediate remittance of the funds within 10 - 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our assurance is that the risk involved with your role shall be reduced to the barest minimal. To accord this transaction the legality it deserves, and for mutual security of the funds, the whole approval procedures shall be legally processed with your name or any company you may nominate as the bona fide beneficiary of the funds.Once more, I want you to understand that having put in over 20 years ofmeritorious service to my country, I am very much averse to having my image and career dented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency. Kindly expedite action as we are well behindschedule to enable us include this transfer in the Second quarter of the 2001 fiscal year contractual payments.Do confirm your interest with a return email to usm2001ng@onebox.comThank You.REGARDS,NURA USMAN._________________________________________________________Do You Yahoo!?Get your free @yahoo.com address at http://mail.yahoo.com

I am pleased to hear that he is making a good recovery. Please pass on our best wishes. I am wondering whether the hospital will have forwarded mum's card if he had already moved on to a convalescent home when it arrived. I have just sent a card to his home address but I do not have the post code. I hope it gets there.I found out from Graham last night that he is returning to Somerset on Wednesday (23rd). I guess that makes it unlikely that you will get to see him this time. There is a strong possibility that he will come in October for the Jazz festival and will bring Jordan with him. Whilst he has been here he has had lots of people trying to persuade him to build houses for them, but I think he misses Jordan so much he can't wait to get home. I am amazed at how much work got done so quickly. The house in Lauragh is finished except for the painting, wood staining and floor varnishing. We can start using it now but we need to avoid putting in too much furniture until the floor is done in some of the rooms at least. Dad has been lending a hand with paths and garden walls and has helped with some painting. I am sure that Mum will help with some planting. All I need now is a couple of really nice weeks in the summer so that I can feel the benefit of it.I hope you can find time to come over again sometime soon. When Alan returns from Vienna next week he should be in a much more relaxed mood, having got his conference presentation out of the way at last. I am sure he will be happy to spend some leisurely days with you and to take you down to Mum and Dad's and to see the house, etc. If Hilary still has her yacht when you come she might also be glad of some help to sail it. She has not ventured out in it since Richard died but is talking about sailing it if she can find some help.Once the next month is over I can also relax a bit. We are just coming into exam time and we all get very fraught at this time of year (with the marking piling up).At last the foot and mouth restrictions are lifting a bit and we are hoping that all riding activities can gradually resume. We have had a rather boring few months - not even able to ride out along the roads. We can now ride down to the beach but we still have to take care not to go near fields full of cattle or sheep! I have just started investigating the idea of a pony for Caitlin. She is riding my horse occasionally in the sand arena and is doing very well with him even though he is rather small for him. I think she might be ready for a pony now but finding the right one is not going to be easy.We will look forward  to seeing you whenever you can manage to get flights.Bye for now,DebPS Dad is using e-mail these days and has got his own e-mail account.

I would like to ask a follow-up question:Do we lose the benefit of the special treatment under the bankruptcy code when we enter into cross-product (i.e. physical and financial products) netting and joint credit support arrangements.  If we agree with a counterparty to net all of our trading exposures under multiple agreements (swap agreements and gas, power, steel, coal, etc. trading agreements) to determine how much credit support should be posted and then only ask for a single LC that supports the whole shebang, do we lose this protection since arguably we are no longer just "under a swap agreement?"

These are:			Any one month	        All monthsCrude oil		10,000			20,000Unleaded gasoline	5,000			7,000Heating oil		5,000			7,000Natural gas		7,000			12,000Any market participant with positions exceeding these levels may be contacted by the Exchange with inquiries regarding the participant's hedging requirements or financial condition. The Exchange would reserve the right to require that the position be reduced or capped.There will no longer be any gross limits on the number of positions that can be held, as long as they are offset by positions on the opposite side of the market (example: a participant with 10,000 long positions in September, October, and November crude oil futures and 10,000 short positions for December and January would be considered to have a net position of 10,000 contracts).These new rules are also intended to apply to the Brent crude oil futures contract, planned for launch this summer. The board has also approved a minimum reporting level of 100 lots for that contract.These rules, which closely resemble those in place for metals traded on the COMEX Division, must be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission prior to implementation.__________________________________________________Please click on the link below to indicate you have received thisemail."http://208.206.41.61/email/email_log.cfm?useremail=mark.taylor@enron.com&refdoc=(01-191)"Note: If you click on the above line and nothing happens, please copythe text between the quotes, open your internet browser,paste it into the web site address and press Return.

It acted as a market maker, p=urchasing storage capacity from StorageNetworks - which was then sold on to= Best Buy, a retailer of electronics products. Crucially, both contracts we=re based on Enron's standard contract and included firm delivery with liqui=dated damages.  In the last few years the storage market has moved from bei=ng a self-managed and owned business to one where storage is served up from= a standard metro network. Enron's involvement will be bring flexibility of= contract offering and imbedded optionality, according to Ravi Thuraisingha=m, a senior trader at Enron. "When we sell the product to the customer we r=emain in the market to buy the capacity back should they wish to unwind the=ir position later. That is unprecedented," says Thuraisingham.   The storag=e market has historically been more flexible and more committed to firm del=ivery than the bandwidth market, but these trades mark a significant develo=pment. Rather than dated damages the storage market has tended to favour di=scounts on future purchases. "There is a premium in the price for firm deli=very," says Thuraisingham.  He says that a number of other market participa=nts are eager to commit to Enron as a market maker. In addition, equipment =vendors are excited by the possibilities of the market. "most storage equip=ment at the moment is supplied to the enterprise market. This development o=pens up the wholesale storage capacity market," says Thuraisingham.   =09
ted.bockius@ivita.com,ted.bockius@ivita.com,ted.bockius@ivita.com,Subject: Another Article,       Broadband Networking News  Mark Holmes 03/27/2001  Enron Hits Back Q=uickly After Blockbuster Failure Houston-based energy and communications co=nglomerate Enron's Enron Broadband Services unit signed a deal with Electro=nics Boutique earlier this month to deliver video games on demand in a bid =to boost content offerings to its broadband customers as part of its entert=ain-on-demand (EOD) service.  Under the terms of the March 19 deal, Electro=nics Boutique subsidiary EBWorld.com will stream leading games for rental t=o Enron 's broadband customers. The deal is a positive development for Enro=n after the collapse of a deal with Blockbuster, which the companies announ=ced March 9, that would have given Enron exclusive rights to deliver movies= for a video-on-demand service.   "The exclusive relationship has not yield=ed the quantity and quality of movies needed to drive demand for this excit=ing new on-demand service," explains Kenneth D. Rice, president and CEO of =Enron Broadband Services.  "The Blockbuster announcement was disappointing,= but I do think the technology and systems to be able to do that are virtua=lly complete," notes James Yannello, a utilities equity analyst at UBS Warb=urg. "I do think they will be able to potentially a deliver a variety of it=ems to end-users. I would guess they need to do some more deals, driving tr=affic on [to] their systems. I think they can bounce back pretty quickly fr=om the Blockbuster deal. I think the blow was more psychological and I woul=d suggest it was used as an excuse for some others to lower some very aggre=ssive price targets on the company, which is what they did."  The failure o=f the Blockbuster deal was a blow for the company as the exclusive 20-year =agreement could have given Enron significant upside in the content delivery= business.   "I don't see Blockbuster as being a broadband killer for Enron= ," Bob Christensen, a utilities equity analyst at First Albany Corp., tell=s Broadband Networking News. "I think they will probably [get] one or two a=nchor tenants before the year is out. I am optimistic."  The deal with Elec=tronics Boutique and the failure of the deal with Blockbuster emphasize the= importance Enron is placing on securing content for its broadband network.= Yet its main revenues from the telecom arena will continue to be derived f=rom its bandwidth intermediation business, which uses pooling points to pro=vide the physical interconnectivity between bandwidth buyers and sellers, a=llowing users to provide bandwidth on demand. This is Enron 's core telecom= business.  The content deals, while important, are not being factored into= most analysts' forecasts on the company.   "I am confident that the conten=t delivery business will be successful," says Ray Niles, a utilities equity= analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "The fact of the matter is they did get a=nother deal. It was not as large as the Blockbuster deal, but they did get =another one in there. We are not putting numbers in our model and our earni=ngs forecast for content delivery. Whether it is very successful or not ver=y successful, in our forecasts, we are not assuming any particular forecast= for the content delivery business. I think bandwidth intermediation is the=ir competitive advantage."  "The reality is that no one had any earnings (f=rom Blockbuster) in the company projections for several years at best," Yan=nello adds. "It was a big name and was portrayed to be the killer app. It i=s disappointing, but I do think they will be able to bounce back with other= deals. I also think in an early sense this gaming announcement is probably= the tip of the iceberg of what they will be able to bring in."  Enron, whi=ch produced revenues of over $101 billion in 2000 from its various business=es, is still rated highly by analysts, despite the failure of the Blockbust=er deal.   "We have a $100 target price and a 'strong buy' rating," Yannell=o says. "That assumes roughly $75 of value for their energy business and $2=5 of value for their broadband services division. I think given what has ha=ppened in the broader market in the telecom arena, and given that the Block=buster deal has falling apart, I think we be will waiting a while before we= expand that $25 telecom valuation."   =09

Instead of "Houston Pipe Line Company," your new counterparty for these transactions executed in the future will be "Enron North America Corp."This change affects EnronOnline physical natural gas products delivered at Carthage, Exxon Katy and Waha locations. We have added the following language to the Product Long Descriptions of these affected products: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the General Terms and Conditions, if applicable, this Transaction is between Counterparty and Enron North America Corp.This language will supersede the language in the first clause of your "General Terms and Conditions" (GTC) agreement, which presently states, "In the event that the Delivery Point for a transaction is located in the state of Texas, "Enron" shall mean Houston Pipe Line Company."Please contact the EnronOnline Help Desk at (713) 853 HELP if you have any questions.

My understanding was that "Worldscale" is not a number denominated in a currency but rather a percentage number which can be used with reference to a currency denominated figure to calculate a price.  That is what it looks like in the Baltic Exchange Limited publication.  I haven't seen the IITRA publication so can't comment on how their quotations are denominated.  The problem is that in the first paragraph of the long description, the Floating Price is defined to be the Index.  Therefore the Index must be a currency denominated number.  That is why in the US version I used the average of the prices "calculated using the Worldscale Assessments."  Do I have this all wrong?

If that is not the case, I don't object to doing away with them altogether.We have approved doing away with confirms for EOL trades on a counterparty by counterparty basis.  We haven't actually gotten there with anyone yet, having just started the actual discussions this week.  Our plan was to negotiate an written agreement with each affected counterparty to amend the master agreements where appropriate.  Initially we are only working on physical power, physical natural gas and derivatives transactions (other than weather).  The idea is that a lawyer from each affected group would be involved to insure that all of the bases are properly covered.  This will obviously be a very time-consuming and laborious process.  The initial list of 10 or 15 counterparties to approach was selected by the back office people.  Our conclusion that this was even possible was based only on Texas and New York law analysis.  If any Canadian deals are at issue, we will need to get you involved both for the analysis and the negotiations.Hope this is helpful.  Let me know if it makes sense to you.MarkP.S. -- Please be careful when sending e-mails to me.  There are two Mark Taylors and we're hard to tell apart.  The other guy has his middle initial ("A") in some of the lists and sometimes there is a globe next to his name, but not mine.  My name usually has my phone number next to it.

But he's in the same department as one of the jobs below (Sr. Purchasing Agent I think), and this position is a more junior slot, so you probably want to be considered for the more senior position first anyway.The Senior Project Manager (80-90%) and Senior Purchasing Agent (80%) slots are still open.  I talked briefly to the managers listed on the postings and have forwarded your resume to them for consideration.  I have no feel for the timing on the Proj. Mgr. position and in fact the manager was a bit brusque, but the guy on the Purch. Agent job said the timing was great since he's taking a stack of resumes home with him this weekend to review.I've left voice-mail messages concerning the Construction Engineer (90%) and Process/Mechanical Engineer II (80%) positions and will forward your resume if they are still looking. On the others, it might make sense to go ahead and go through the application process on the website.  Particularly for the one that says not to contact them directly -- there's no pointing in making them mad before they even see your resume!I'll keep you posted on the others.  If there are no answers to my voicemails by the middle to end of next week, you might want to submit for those on the website, too.  At least then you know your resume is in the hopper.Mark

Not entirely, they have to meet certain more restrictive tests depending on how they are organized (i.e. how sophisticated are the investors).  A fund group like Fidelity that allows my Mom to invest has to have $1,000,000,000 in assets.  A true hedge fund that limits its investors to those meeting certain sophistication requirements only needs $100,000,000 in total assets.3. Yes4. Only if we become "regulated."  Currently we still maintain that we are a one-to-many site and are not yet subject to these rules.

lhayman@skadden.com,lhayman@skadden.com,lhayman@skadden.com,Subject: QE2,I have tentatively booked us on the QE2 sailing from Southampton at 5pm on August 29, arriving New York at 7:30am on September 4.  You and Amanda have a Caronia class cabin at $2045.32 per person, including air from New York to London (with a business class upgrade on Continental).  I have a single in the same class (so we eat in the same restaurant).  My plan would be to fly over on Sunday evening - the 26th - since I have to be in Ohio that morning.  With that in mind I have also booked jr. suites for us at "41" the all-inclusive London hotel near Buckingham Palace that I've mentioned to you before.  They are at 275 GBP per night (2 nights).  Of course, if you guys wanted to go earlier to spend more time in London, I am sure that would be possible.The difficulty is that Amanda has indicated an interest in staying in Europe longer - certainly understandable.  Her preference would be to go over on the boat leaving NY on September 5, arriving in Southampton Sept. 10 and then stay in Europe for a few weeks.  That doesn't work quite as well for me because I only have 6 vacation days left and on that routing I get one less day in London - i.e. we get off the boat on Monday morning and I have to fly back Tuesday morning.  On the other hand, we wouldn't be jet lagged on arrival in London!They will hold the reservation until tomorrow.

louise.kitchen@enron.com,louise.kitchen@enron.com,louise.kitchen@enron.com,Subject: Limit Order Wash Trades,X-FileName: MTAYLO1 (Non-Privileged).pstI hope this isn't too late.  If you need to reach me, I'm in the London office today and tomorrow.I think the correct approach is to revise the functionality and add a line or two to the description of how limit orders work, an answer in the FAQ section, a line for the 'Failed Transaction' screen and a script for the help desk.  I'm thinking of something to the effect of:Once a limit order has been placed by a counterparty, that counterparty will not be able to complete a transaction with Enron in that product on the other side of the market at the price specified in the limit order.  For example, if a counterparty enters a limit order to sell to Enron at price x, that counterparty may not buy from Enron at price x while the limit order is active.Note that this needs to be done on a counterparty basis, not at the sub user level.  That needs to be clear from the language we use so I have avoided the chattier 'you' and used counterparty.The 'Failed Transaction' screen could show the failure reason as:'Your company has an active limit order in effect at the price at which you attempted to transact.  The limit order system does not allow you to transact with Enron on both sides of the market at the same price simultaneously.'If you want to keep it short, the second sentence is optional as long as the necessary descriptive language appears somewhere on the web site.Mark TaylorVice President and General CounselEnron Wholesale Services(713)853-7459

To compete effectively in your industry, you need a way to control the risk created by price volatility. Enron can help with financial price management tools that can smooth earnings, facilitate cash flow management, and bring greater certainty to financing, investment and acquisition decisions.  Helping Ammonia and Fertilizer Producers Improve their BusinessFew industries are more competitive or volatile than ammonia or fertilizers. From the very unstable pricing found in the markets for raw materials to the ebb and flow of market demand for finished products, producers can face enormous challenges in maintaining profit margins and cash flows.Now there's help. For many years, Enron has been helping producers like you neutralize the risk of price volatility both upstream and downstream, using financial price management tools we pioneered more than a decade ago for the energy industry. Because Enron is a major trader of many commodities around the world, we're intimately familiar with the risks you face and are uniquely positioned to help you mitigate them. Enron can also make it easier for you to trade the commodities you buy and sell, using EnronOnline, our Internet-based, global transaction system for commodities that allows you to view real-time prices and transact instantly online. EnronOnline posts bid and offer prices for over 1,500 global commodity products as well as complimentary weather, news and market information. In addition, it allows you to view full contractual terms and available volumes for products.[Spread 2]Finally, we can leverage, in your market, our position as the largest wholesaler of natural gas and electricity in North America. For example, we can structure cross-commodity transactions that link your electricity or natural gas bills to the price of the goods you produce. In this type of transaction, you would pay more for energy when your product prices are high when you can best afford it, and less when your product prices are low and your cash flows are constrained.Helping Ammonia and Fertilizer Consumers Improve their BusinessThe ammonia and fertilizer markets that you depend upon are among the most volatile in the world. Yet your investors and lenders are demanding ever-greater stability in the growth of your company's revenues, earnings and cash-flow. For solutions to this apparent paradox, turn to Enron. As a leading provider of price management services across various industries, we can help you buy the commodities you need more efficiently, hedge the risks associated with their pricing, and, ultimately, lower your cost of capital. Take a few moments to review the alternatives listed here, then spend a few more moments with Enron. We'll review your risk exposure with you and suggest risk-reducing strategies for taking control of your commodity price exposure.[Spread 3]SWAPSSwaps are the most widely used price risk management tool for a variety of reasons, the most common being, no upfront transaction cost. Swaps give companies the ability to effectively switch from one price structure to another - from floating price to fixed or vice versa. They are used most often to fix, or lock in, prices and margins between prices. In exchange for price protection, the ability to capitalize on some beneficial price movements is sacrificed.The typical swap transaction involves the exchange of a fixed price for a variable price tied to an acceptable market index. Settlement is financial - i.e., cash changes hands; physical product does not. Each month during the life of the transaction, the difference between the two prices is calculated and payment is made to the appropriate party.[Spread 4]Swap: Producer example AmmoniaKing, a producer of ammonia, is interested in managing the margin between natural gas feedstock and ammonia during the next six months. The company is concerned that market conditions could deteriorate more than expected and squeeze margins to the point of jeopardizing the annual profit plan. To eliminate this threat, AmmoniaKing enters into a swap with Enron that locks in the spread between natural gas and ammonia at $100/ton on 300,000 tons of ammonia, or 75 percent of monthly production. This margin virtually ensures that the ammonia unit will meet its financial target.[chart 1]DURING THE LIFE OF THE SWAP:?        AmmoniaKing continues to purchase natural gas from suppliers and sell ammonia to customers of its choice, at floating market prices.?        On a monthly basis, AmmoniaKing and Enron exchange payments equal to the difference between the fixed spread of $100/ton and the prevailing floating price spread.?        For example, if the floating spread is $95/ton in a given month, AmmoniaKing will receive $5/ton in a given month on 300,000 tons. However, if the floating spread is $105/ton AmmoniaKing will owe $5/ton to Enron.?        AmmoniaKing has stabilized a portion of its operating margin with the swap, giving the company the ability to achieve a key performance target. [Spread 5]Swap: End-user example FertPro, a manufacturer of a variety of fertilizer products, is preparing its annual price catalog for many of its ammonia-based products. The company's customer base demands the ability to buy the products at the listed catalog price regardless of ammonia feedstock prices. This makes it impossible for FertPro to pass on feedstock price increases no matter what the magnitude. On the other hand, customers don't necessarily expect lower prices if ammonia feedstock prices should fall; they simply want a listed price they can count on. To service its customers while protecting its margins, FertPro enters into a one-year price swap. The swap effectively fixes the price of ammonia at $100/ton on a monthly volume of 10,000 tons, or 75 percent of anticipated monthly catalog sales.[chart 2]DURING THE LIFE OF THE SWAP:?        FertPro continues to purchase ammonia from suppliers of its choice at floating market prices.?        On a monthly basis, FertPro and Enron exchange payments equal to the difference between the swap fixed price of $100/ton and the floating price for ammonia.?        For example, if the floating price for ammonia is $105 in a given month, FertPro will receive $5/ton on 10,000 tons. However, if the floating price is $95/ton FertPro will owe $5/ton to Enron.?        The net effect of combining the swap cash flows with actual purchases of ammonia feedstock is a fixed price of $100/ton.?        The swap enables FertPro to publish and stand behind its listed prices with full confidence that the margin on those sales is largely protected from fluctuating feedstock prices. [Spread 6]CAPS & FLOORSLike Swaps, Caps and Floors provide price protection, but they have the added advantage of providing benefit from favorable price movements. They are commonly thought of as price "insurance," i.e., for a premium you are entitled to full price protection when prices move through a specified level. A price Cap protects against rising prices without sacrificing the advantage of falling prices. Floors are the opposite of Caps; they guard against falling prices while preserving upside price potential.With a Cap or Floor, the full cost of the protection is predefined - it is equal to the premium paid for the Cap or Floor. There are no potential future costs related to price movements.[Spread 7]Cap: End-User exampleCropFood, a manufacturer of urea, wants to develop business with a prospect that has difficulty passing on price increases, but is expected to pass on decreases without delay.To distinguish itself from competitors, CropFood ensures the prospect that for the next 12 months, CropFood will never ask for a price increase above its very competitive product prices, no matter how high ammonia feedstock prices go. And to sweeten the deal, CropFood agrees to promptly pass on all feedstock price decreases as soon as they are announced, no questions asked.The prospect likes CropFood's straightforward pricing policy and agrees to purchase 1,000 tons of urea per month. In order to honor its pricing promise without putting the company's margins at risk to rising prices, CropFood purchases a one-year price cap on ammonia at $120/ton for 12,000 tons per month. The cost of the cap is $2/ton.[chart 3]DURING THE LIFE OF THE CAP AGREEMENT:?        CropFood continues to buy ammonia from its regular suppliers at market prices.?        Enron receives a $2/ton premium from CropFood for the $120/ton price cap.?        If the market price for ammonia goes above $120/ton in a given month, Enron will pay the difference to CropFood. If prices are less than $120/ton, CropFood enjoys the lower market prices for its feedstock.?        The effective cost of ammonia paid by CropFood is the floating market price up to a maximum of $120/ton plus the $2/ton premium paid for the cap.?        CropFood has, for a known cost of $2/ton captured new business by meeting the customer's price needs without putting the company at risk to ammonia prices in the process. [Spread 8]Floor: Producer exampleAmmoniaKing, a producer of ammonia, anticipates a plant turnaround starting in three months time and lasting for two months. The company intends to build extra ammonia inventory of 50,000 tons over the next three months to meet sales obligations during the two-month period the plant is taken off-line. There is concern that prices could soften over the two-month turnaround period, squeezing the margin on the excess inventory to be sold during that time.To protect against a sharp price reduction during the turnaround period, AmmoniaKing buys a two-month ammonia price floor today that becomes effective in three months time. The floor price is set at $145 and costs $3/ton. The total premium payable by AmmoniaKing is $150,000 (50,000 tons multiplied by $3/ton).[chart 4] EACH MONTH DURING THE LIFE OF THE PRICE FLOOR:?        AmmoniaKing sells excess ammonia inventory to its customers at prevailing market (floating) prices.?        Enron receives a $3/ton premium from AmmoniaKing for the $145/ton price floor.?        If the floating price for ammonia is greater than the $145/ton floor price, there is no action under the floor contract. The effective price received by AmmoniaKing for its ammonia is the floating market price less the $3/ton premium.?        If the floating price goes below the $145/ton floor price to $140/ton, for example, AmmoniaKing will receive the $5/ton difference from Enron. In this instance, AmmoniaKing effective price for ammonia is $142/ton - the $145/ton floor price less the $3/ton premium.?        In summary, the price floor has established a minimum price of $145/ton with full upside potential at a known cost of $3/ton.

I haven't been back to NYC since I left on the QE2 on 9/4.  Every time I heard about the conditions downtown I assumed you would be living in the country.  Sorry to hear you had to spend so much time in a hotel.  I know what that can be like and it loses any appeal it ever had very quickly.  Also sorry to hear about Mrs. B.  I hope she is doing better.It has been chaotic and very depressing here -- not that our acquisition deal went through but that we ever got in the position to need the deal to go through in the first place.  In fact, when they finally announced it, my primary feeling was one of relief.  Things had gotten very bad.  Next time we get together I can fill you in on all the details.  At least for now I am still employed and my prospects are pretty good under the circumstances.It's nice you have Key West to get away to.  You'll have to tell me about the house that you have available but under the circumstances I doubt that I could get away often enough to justify taking on a lease.  It would be nice to get away from here now and then though.  I was supposed to go to Ft. Lauderdale (did you know Ted was living there now?) a few weeks ago to visit and go to the big boat show there.  That trip had to be cancelled in all the confusion around here.  I had hoped to be in New York today for a seminar (where I was actually scheduled to speak) but cancelled that also.  With luck things will start to get back to normal here soon.  I'm really feeling the need for a break (and 4 days in Cincinnati next week don't count) so maybe I can come visit some time in the next couple of months.Tell Don I said Hi.Mark

I left you a voice mail this morning on your cell phone to let you know I'm OK and stranded in London.  Not a bad place to get stranded I suppose.  Linda and Amanda are here, too.  I'm working from the office here while they have fun on the town.  Actually, they seem to be spending a lot of time at the hotel watching the news, and I can't say that I totally blame them -- it seems almost disloyal to go out and have fun.  They were going to a play this afternoon and got tickets for us to see Mama Mia (the musical based on ABBA) for tomorrow night.  I was originally scheduled to fly back yesterday (Wednesday) and have been rebooked on a flight Sunday afternoon.  The hotel finally told me this morning that we can keep our rooms until then.  I hope the flights are running by then.Kitty is being taken care of but I feel really bad having her be alone all this time.  Jim Avant was stranded in Austin for a day -- they had to take a taxi back to Houston the next day -- and Jamie said they would go over that afternoon.

legal <.taylor@enron.com>,legal <.taylor@enron.com>,legal <.taylor@enron.com>,Subject: RE: VMAC Transaction,I think there is a real possibility here.  It would be extremely challenging commercially.How do we convince customers to participate?Two distinct areas:  (i) Existing portfolio of business and (ii) New business.New business is easier in one sense since everything is at the money, who would say no to a AAA credit?  Still requires significant amendment to existing trading documentation and where existing trades are present, separating them out as not netting with new trades.Existing business is easy for counterparties who are already in the money -- they will want the improved credit.  But how do we convince the out of the money side of the equation to participate?  This seem to me to be the biggest hurdle.Issues:Requires consent of customers and significant amendment of existing contracts.	Adequate incentive for customers currently out of the money to participate?	Might make more sense where no current positions exist.	Contract hurdles:	Need to allow for termination by defaulting party so Enron (VMAC) will be able to control termination on default.	Need the consent of counterparty to assign contract to VMAC.	May require changing permitted credit support from counterparties (letters of credit probably don't work).If we are attempting to put an existing book of business into the structure, an initial chunk of money will have to be given to VMAC to secure the existing out of the money side of the portfolio - how much is it and do we have that money?It's not clear how the proposal allows for credit lines to and from counterparties.  That is, if we have given an aggregate $200 million credit line to out of the money counterparties and have only been given an aggregate $100 million credit line to in the money counterparties, will VMAC be satisfied with the mismatch.  Will we continue to control the amount of credit we give to customers?  If we go to 100% collateral requirements for all participating transactions, this is solved since there can't be a mismatch.  (Will customers agree to 100% collateral requirements - i.e. no credit lines?)Once the supported/participating portfolio is out of the money, Enron will have to post collateral to VMAC.  If we fail, VMAC can default all participating/supported contracts.  When all of the contracts are terminated with Enron as the defaulting party, the payments to and from counterparties are calculated on their side of the market.  Presumably VMAC will require some cushion to cover this.

adam.giannone@enron.com,adam.giannone@enron.com,adam.giannone@enron.com,Subject: some info,Duke University football practice was delayed for two hours yesterday in the midst of what was an anthrax scare. One of the players, while on his way to the locker room, happened to look down and notice a unknown white powdery substance on the practice field. Third-year Blue Devils head coach Carl Franks immediately suspended practice while the FBI was called in to investigate. After a complete field analysis, the FBI determined that the white substance unknown to the players was the goal line. Practice was resumed when FBI special agents decided that the Blue Devils, winless in their last 22 games, would not be likely to encounter the substance ever, ever again.Jason MorrowArlington, Va.

trevor.woods@enron.com,trevor.woods@enron.com,trevor.woods@enron.com,Subject: NOx SIP CALL 2004 Balance,Trevor,This e-mail is attempting to answer the request made by you and Scott a few weeks ago. Attached are my projected balance for 2004 NOx SIP CALL.  It is based on numbers from EEA (environment consultants), EPA website, NOx SIP Call model, and new generation database.  The confidence level for overall balance is not that high.  The OTR states only need to reduce 15% from 2001 to 2003 to be in compliance.  They have some SCRs already built and the plans for the other SCRs needed.  The non-OTR states are far more dirty than the OTR states.  The big question mark is the cost of technology that will be available for the 2004 states.  I believe that there will be a demand for allowances.  I believe the NOx SIP Call market to be a short at this point.  People think it is worse than it really is.Also, I can make a price forecast.  The confidence level would be low on the price forecast.  What else do you want here?   Mike Taylor
john.massey@enron.com,john.massey@enron.com,john.massey@enron.com,Subject: NOx OTR flow control,FYI . . .Below is written by our environmental consultant EEA>>Based on the preliminary emissions data for 2001 just released, the allowance surplus for this year is 23,189 tons bringing the total bank at the end of the year to 83,778 tons.  This would mean a flow control value of 0.26 or a discount factor of 0.63 for 2002.  The exact flow control/discount values cannot be calculated right now because they will depend on how many banked allowances are used for compliance this year and also on the implementation of the Maryland consent decree which the state and EPA probably wont figure out until next year.  But we are pretty much in that range.<<

Linda and I both had to reschedule our flights and did it directly with the airline (Continental for me and Virgin for Linda).  Of course, in our cases the original flights were cancelled.  I don't have the Cunard reservations number here and haven't been able to access the web site this afternoon.  I will get it for you when I get home.  The fax number for the guest relations department is (305)463-3030.In a sense I felt safer in London than here.  Once we got off the QE2 we weren't doing anything that would have made us attractive targets and I don't anticipate attacks against individual Americans overseas -- at least not outside of Muslim countries.  While there was an increase in police presence around town, we didn't hear of any actual threats to Americans while we were in London.  Airport security has been better there than here for a long time and now has been beefed up even further.  The Europeans just have more recent experience at dealing with terrorists than we do.  The sword rattling doesn't bother me too much.  I've been overseas during some tense international times before and as long as you're in a friendly country it shouldn't be an issue.  On the other hand, it REALLY feels good to be home and I can sure understand your wanting to have her with you.From her point of view, I think that while the Brits were all being very sympathetic and supportive, the tragedy just isn't as immediate there and so the impact on Amanda has been somewhat less than if we had been home.  Given that, I think she doesn't want to waste this opportunity to do something fun in Europe while she has the chance and is already over there.  For me I have to say it was hard to have any fun after Tuesday noon, although I tried to put a good face on it.  I don't know when that will improve since I'm still pretty depressed.  It's probably even worse for you since you were so much closer to things than I am.  The lawyer in me sees two sides: (a) a trip to Paris is just the thing to take your mind off of events and (b) why waste a week of vacation and travel hassles when you aren't going to have a good time no matter where you go.Feel free to give me a call if you want to chat.Good luck!Mark

According to the power trading lawyers who have worked with the FERC in the past, they never provide protection for what we would consider confidential commercial information even when they have the authority to do so.  If we want that kind of protection, it should be mandated, not made possible by regulatory action.  I'm not necessarily recommending a change, I just don't want anyone to be taking any comfort from section (d).

The way the web site works, the decision to accept or reject the offer happens almost instantaneously so the question is almost meaningless.  The time we care is when the internet slows down or the connection goes down and they don't see that we accepted their offer and then they try to get out.  I guess the other question would be how do they withdraw the offer?  The website doesn't provide a mechanism for that.  If we say it has to be in writing and delivered to the relevant trader, in practice it might not be an issue.

Just so you have the whole picture -- our analysis f=rom a US law perspective is that there is a tension between wanting the tra=nsactions on the system to be enforceable and wanting out of the mistake tr=ades.  The offline unwind is by far the best approach when the mistake is n=ot blatant since it assumes the binding nature of the original trade.  We h=ave been handling these by using a written termination rather than a revers=e trade.  This is universally the approach we have taken when our traders h=ave agreed to let a customer out of a trade the customer claims was done by= mistake on their part.  This happens often enough that we have given the c=onfirm desk a termination agreement form to use as needed (Tana can get you= a copy if you want it).  But when the counterparty refuses to let us out o=f a trade that is a mistake on our part, our only hope is that the mistake =is so blatant that we can claim mutual mistake.  Under US law when there is= mutual mistake the contract is actually never formed.  In that case, the o=riginal trade is not enforceable and there is nothing to unwind.  One alter=native we have used is to simply remove the transaction from the customer's= "completed transactions" section as if it had never happened.  As far as I= know, we have only had to do this once or twice.
