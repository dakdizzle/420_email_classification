david.woodstrom@enron.com,david.woodstrom@enron.com,david.woodstrom@enron.com,Subject: FW: charts,X-FileName: MSMITH18 (Non-Privileged).pstDave,Since I'm thinking of it, what we'd like to strive for is, for one, to be able to double click on the bars and get a list of the the plant outages that make up the total and also to be able to select date ranges.  Also, it would be be great to be able to be able to select daily or monthly averages over a day range or month range, respectively.  Maybe have the current page be the default with control boxes to modify the criteria.  Mat

Nice work!  I'm already thinking of many other things we'd like to have.  Does this charting tool, allow us to customize the chart features to the extent excel does?  Can you manually set the min and max values on the axis?  We like some of the charts to have the same axis settings so that the bars can be compared from one chart to the next.  If so, Jason can tell you how we'd like them set.  Let's also discuss what interactivity we can build into this page. Mat

These are based on Socal's published long-term storage tariff.  I cannot confirm whether Socal has capacity at these rates available to sell.  Keep in mind I don't think the LNG project would incur the entire cost of the storage, as ENA could extract additional value from optimizing its operation.

colin.tonks@enron.com,colin.tonks@enron.com,colin.tonks@enron.com,Subject: Plant Outage Task,X-FileName: Smith, Matt.pstColin,Per our conversation, I have outlined Keith's task for the team....Background:  Portland maintains in their database a table called "PlantOutage".  Records in that table each contain an outage "BeginOutageDate", "EndOutageDate", "CapacityOut" and "OutageReason".  Records also include a PlantID (key field for PlantCharacteristics table) and a PlantUnitID (key field for Unitcharacteristics table).  The PlantCharacteristics table contains a "WSCCRegion" field and the Unitcharacteristics table contains a "Fuel_Designation" field.  Portland has a stored procedure that for a specified date range can calculate for each date the sum of "CapacityOut" for all outage records where the date falls between the "BeginOutageDate" and the "EndOutageDate".  I have inlcuded the results of this storaged procedure in the attached file.  Our task is similar but requires more detailed subgrouping of the data.Objective:  The objective is to return the Sum of "CapacityOut" by each possible subgrouping for each day in a range (say 1/1/2000 to 1/1/2001).  There are roughly five possible parameters for "Fuel_Designation", seven for "WSCCRegion", and two for "OutageReason".  The resulting query would return approximately 70 values for each day within the specified range.Format:  Ultimately we will have the date in one excel sheet with dates down the left and each of the 70 sub groupings across the top.  It would be most convenient if the results of the query were formatted in this way.  Alternatively, we can use a pivot table if the results of a list query are provided.  If the second option is used, we will need to get the data in two separate lists since excel can only hand 65,000+ rows.  In this case, we would use the "OutageReason" grouping (which only has two parameters) to split out the two lists.  Thanks for your help.Mat

chris.hyde@enron.com,chris.hyde@enron.com,chris.hyde@enron.com,Subject: Storage Balances,X-FileName: Smith, Matt.pstChris,Per our conversation, the following table shows four storage inventories that we need to track/compute/report, etc.BackgroundThe west desk currently displays storage balances on several of the morning reports.  These balances are not reported by the respective pipelines, however, each day the injections and withdrawals are available.  In the past, our excel spreadsheets have tracked the running balances by simply adding the current daily activity to the prior day's balance.  As we get validation of the balances through phone calls, and/or postings, we tweak the balances to maintain an accurate representation.  Currently, our reporting/storage system does not allow us to make these balances available on our reports.TaskSynthesize the currently used method of displaying storage balances for the storage facilities shown on the following table.  It is our intent to have a DRN established (and some already have been created) that would hold the storage balance each day.  However, this requires that a calculation be executed to determine the value to be placed in the database.  One possibility is to have the scraping script make the necessary calculation and store the new storage balance each time the pipeline is scraped.  Another possibility is to incorporate the ability to do these calculations in the report, while a third option is too keep a spreadsheet with storage balances that queries the database for the daily activity.  Lastly, these storage balances could be manual entry points, but would require manual calculation each day (representing a lower level of performance than the existing system for this feature).TimelineThis is a necessary feature before transitioning from the current spreadsheets.  At a minimum, we need to have temporary system in place before the end of the week.  Although, we do not have a final date for transitioning, we see this as one of a few critical tasks.Mat <Embedded Microsoft Excel Worksheet>

As I indicated earlier, SWG may have deliveries off of Socal which we would not be able to see.  Also, there may be unidentified SWG meter points not included in the attached file, and we are missing some days of data so the actual numbers may be a little higher.  Finally, if this data is used for pricing/hedging analysis, one should be careful which prices they use for comparison.  SWG territory in California would be subject to California pricing, while that closer to the producing basins would be priced differently.  In addition, Southwest Gas owns transport capacity on El Paso, such that they were really only vulnerable to San Juan or Keystone price fluxuations, and not Socal.  You could only make a hedging estimate if you knew their transport capacity, which I do not (it is available on El Paso's website).  Anyway, that's all I have.Mat

phil.polsky@enron.com,phil.polsky@enron.com,phil.polsky@enron.com,Subject: Gas Production,Phil,How's this for starters... The San Juan plant receipts and Rockies production information should be accurate.  The third tab, Keystone Receipts, is definitely not comprehensive.  That information is for El Paso Natural Gas only, and only the first section of the table has the receipt points values.  Unfortunately, a lot of production in Keystone moves onto intrastate pipelines that we do not have data for.  I'll see if I can get together at least some TW and Northern numbers for the Perm and that might be as good as we can get.  Mat

I lost about $100,000 this morning because I'm an idiot, but it's not completely my fault.  Anyway, you should definitely take an earlier flight so we could go to dinner or something.  Too bad it's not at the end of week so you could stay over, even though if you wanted to, you could.  I could leave work pretty much anytime on wednesday, so just let me know.  If you don't have my work number, its 713-853-0472.  Thanks.Mat
