I was so glad to get your voice message the other day (week).  It is always nice to pick up a voicemail and have it turn out to be a colleague from the not so distant past.  I hope you and your family are doing well.As EBS changed direction, I did as well.  I decided to get back to my roots in the gas and gas asset business.  I looked inside of Enron and also with some outside companies and decided to work with Transwestern pipeline (an Enron company).  I've been here for about a month and all is well.  The people here are very nice and very genuine (just like my old friends from London).  It is weird to actually have a product to sell - if you know what I mean.  I think I'll like it but I'm already missing my travels in your neck of the woods.  Also, I'm home so much now, my wife doesn't know what to do with me.I'm still saddened by the demised of our Blockbuster/VOD deal.  It was a great concept and it worked.  Oh well.  We'll see it someday, I'm just not sure who is going to win the race on getting it to the public in bulk.Christian sent an email to me and he seems to be doing fine, loving Rio but still looking for a job.  Speaking of that, I hope your job is going well and as secure as it can be in today's climate.It is a strange time here in America.  The terrorist attacks, the retaliation in Afghanistan and the constant update on new discoveries of the spread of Anthrax are constantly being talked about and on every news channel.  It is amazing how a handful of people can create such sadness and effect the world in so many ways.  There is no doubt that the spirit of the people will prevail.Take care Martin.

The Commission believes closer scrutiny is called for because these t=ransactions appear to provide the opportunity to impose rates many multiple=s in excess of maximum approved tariff rates.=20The Commission had issued a suspension order in each proceeding that, among= other things, directed GTN to explain (1) how it had the firm capacity ava=ilable to move gas under the transactions in these proceedings, and (2) why= its entering into the subject negotiated service agreements did not violat=e regulations and policy regarding firm transportation service and negotiat=ed rate agreements. The new expedited hearing procedures are intended to fu=rther explore these matters. Pending the outcome, GTN must revise both its =tariff and capacity availability postings to provide for clear identificati=on of operational capacity; and must post and contract operational capacity= on each day of its availability (i.e., on a day-to-day basis), unless it c=an demonstrate such capacity will be available for some longer period of ti=me.=20Questions Same as Those Addressed to Transwestern Earlier=20FERC's concerns in this case are remarkably similar to FTS-1 deals recently= arranged by Transwestern Pipeline Co. (RP97-288) that are now the subject =of an expedited hearing and investigation. Beginning in January 2001, Trans=western made a series of eight filings implementing FTS-1 negotiated transa=ctions with five shippers. The filings were accepted and suspended, subject= to conditions, by orders issued March 2 and 28 and April 27. Staff issued =data requests to Transwestern , Sempra and Richardson. In the March 28 orde=r, FERC also directed Transwestern to show cause why its negotiated rate tr=ansactions did not violate the regulations. Transwestern answered that the =negotiated rate contracts at issue, and any others for that matter, would n=ot have been any less firm or provided a lower quality of service had shipp=ers elected, instead, to pay the recourse rate. Underlying these transactio=ns, Transwestern said, is capacity that becomes available only for a short =time.=20In July the Commissioners voted to establish the hearing to further explore= Transwestern 's negotiated transactions that tied rates to gas spot market= price differentials between the California border and producing basins in =New Mexico and West Texas. For service to the border, Sempra Energy Trading= Corp., Richardson Products Co., BP Energy Co., Astra Power LLC and Reliant= Energy Services elected to pay Transwestern negotiated rates as high as $2=7/MMBtu compared to a maximum FTS-1 (recourse) rate of 38 cents/MMBtu, excl=uding surcharges and fuel.=20In Transwestern 's case, the Commission expressed the belief that closer sc=rutiny of transactions that provide the opportunity to impose rates many mu=ltiples in excess of maximum approved tariff rates is necessary: "Did Trans=western withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available und=er recourse service in order to make the capacity available under negotiate=d rate charges at substantially higher rates?" (See REPORT NO. 2346, pp9-10=.)=20Background=20Beginning in March 2001, GTN made a series of separate filings pursuant to =its rights to implement various negotiated rate transactions under its FTS-=1 Rate Schedule with (1) Sempra, (2) Dynegy Marketing and Trade, (3) Relian=t Energy Services Canada Ltd., (4) Western Gas Resources (Western), (5) Ens=erco Energy, Inc., (6) Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, L.P. , (7) BP Ener=gy Co., and (8) CEG Energy Options, Inc.. The filings were accepted and sus=pended, subject to further proceedings by orders issued on 3/28/01, 5/1/01,= 5/31/01, and 6/29/01. The transactions established transportation rates ti=ed to natural gas spot market price differentials between the Northwest Pip=eline interconnection at Stanfield, Oregon and the Pacific Gas and Electric= Co. and Tuscarora Gas Transmission Co. interconnection at Malin, on the Or=egon-California border.=20According to the data collected by FERC, the negotiated rate transactions w=ould yield average daily transportation rates many multiples of the maximum= FTS-1 rate (approximately $0.155/MMBtu, Stanfield to Malin), exclusive of =surcharges and fuel, based on the publicly reported price differentials at =the contract receipt and delivery points during the term of the contracts. =The Commission initiated additional review procedures to further explore qu=estions regarding conditions under which operational transportation capacit=y may be available on the GTN system.=20GTN has already told the Commission that all negotiated rate shippers knew =service was available at the recourse rate, but that these shippers chose t=o structure the pricing of their contracts in this distinct fashion anyway.= Further, GTN insists the subject firm capacity was posted as available on =the company's website and EBB, consistent with the Commission's regulations=.=20Pursuant to the suspension order, FERC received the following information:==20- Sempra clarified that 10,000 MMBtu/d of its 20,000 MMBtu/d total capacity= arrangement with GTN was subscribed at the FTS-1 rate. But GTN insists Sem=pra requested firm backhaul service with the intent of reversing the path. =Under the negotiated alternative, Sempra was persuaded it would not have to= pay reservation charges on the full MDQ for a secondary, lower priority re=verse path service. In its response, Sempra asserted it wanted to use the c=apacity on a secondary basis and thus chose to negotiate a rate structure t=hat would best reflect its price risk profile to account for the fact that =the capacity may not be available every day. Further, Sempra stated that th=e gas transported was sold into the daily markets at Malin, PG&E's citygate=, or the Southern California border market.=20- Dynegy's rationale for choosing a rate formula rather than the FTS-1 reco=urse rate was to gain additional value from the capacity. GTN had suggested= it could enter into a negotiated agreement based on the daily index-to-ind=ex spread because the Stanfield-Malin spread, less fuel, did not cover the =cost of the FTS-1 recourse rate. Based on GTN's information, Dynegy believe=d the price spread was expected to widen and thereby would give it "a prici=ng opportunity."=20- According to Western, it initially sought 20,000 MMBtu/d of capacity at t=he FTS-1 recourse rate, but GTN's response did not allow for the total volu=me to be shipped at that rate. Instead, GTN proposed and Western accepted a=nother price option: 10,000 MMBtu/d at the FTS-1 Recourse Rate and 10,000 M=MBtu/d at the Negotiated Gas Daily Index Rate.=20- Neither Reliant nor Enserco filed a response to the Commission's 5/1/01 o=rder.=20- Mirant cited three reasons for choosing the monthly index spread rather t=han the recourse rate: 1) the index spread was easily hedged, 2) at the tim=e the market spread was more desirable, and 3) reduction of market risk. Mi=rant believed there were no other practical options to move gas from Stanfi=eld to Malin.=20- GTN established four negotiated rate agreements with two different shippe=rs: BP Energy and CEG Energy. The BP Energy agreement was accepted as propo=sed, but FERC accepted and suspended the CEG Energy agreements subject to r=efund and further information. Similar to the other parties, CEG Energy sta=ted that it chose a negotiated rate rather than the recourse rate because i=t believed the index spread was less expensive than the FTS-1 recourse rate=.=20FERC Has Serious Concerns=20According to the September 13 order, GTN's negotiated rate transactions und=er investigation "present several serious concerns." Even with the addition=al information in hand, the Commission concludes that the filings raise man=y issues that need to be investigated further. Accordingly, an expedited he=aring should explore issues including, but not limited to: whether the tran=sportation capacity was advertised and awarded in an accurate and fair mann=er consistent with GTN's tariff; whether the rates negotiated by GTN were t=he product of an exercise of market power (i.e., did GTN withhold capacity =that otherwise could have been made available under recourse service just t=o make the capacity available under negotiated higher rates); why the shipp=ers agreed to these rates when lower recourse rates should have been availa=ble; and, lastly, whether the practice of improving a shipper's standing in= the scheduling process by selling firm transportation to undesirable prima=ry points so an alternative point can be nominated is discriminatory agains=t interruptible transportation shippers (since the alternative point is als=o available on a somewhat best-efforts basis).=20Since the negotiated rate transactions also raise concerns regarding GTN's =posting procedures and its use of firm service contracts for operational ca=pacity, the Commission also spelled out the need to require GTN to undertak=e immediately certain measures to identify more clearly the operational cap=acity available on the GTN system and the period for which such capacity is= awarded.=20Finally, the Commission discovered discrepancies between GTN and the other =negotiated parties' representations regarding the capacity quantities avail=able at the FTS-1 recourse rate. Specifically, FERC's concerns go to the Se=mpra and Western rate agreements whereby the parties initially desired 20,0=00 MMBtu/d at the recourse rate but were provided with a combination of rec=ourse service and a negotiated service. These actions by GTN may reflect th=e exercise of market power and manipulation of the capacity market, the Com=mission surmises.Mark McConnellTranswestern Pipeline Company713-345-7896   office713-822-4862   cell713-646-2551   faxmark.mcconnell@enron.com
