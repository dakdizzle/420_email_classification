mark.mcconnell@enron.com,mark.mcconnell@enron.com,mark.mcconnell@enron.com,Subject: Brief of Amsterdam Weather Conference,Weather Trading Energy and weather are so inextricably tied to one another that it is sometimes hard to separate the two. The demand for power is directly related to temperature going up in summer and going down in winter. If, therefore, you have an unusually cool summer, the demand for power will be much lesser than anticipated, and the same in case of an unusually warm winter. Several electricity utilities enter into power purchase agreements based on anticipated demand, and would face serious financial losses in such cases. Weather derivatives provide such companies an option to hedge against risk of weather fluctuations. It is no surprise, then, that one of the conferences more lively discussions centered on the presentation by Tom Fletcher, head of weather trading for Mirant <http://www.mirant.com/>. In describing weather trading, Fletcher reported the market has grown exponentially since it was first formed in 1997. Fletcher highlighted how successful trading requires purchasing the right product. He went on to describe some of the sophisticated products being launched and how Mirant is integrating weather risk into their overall profile and what that means for the traders on the floor. With presentations from other market leaders such as Centrica, I-Wex, Spectron, Aquila, LIFFE, Mirant, Bewag, Aon and Entergy-Koch, Weather Trading Europe <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/weather/> provided three days of the latest developments in European trading. The conference touched on key issues surrounding the sector including liquidity in the weather market-where is it and how to access it; data issues-the state of play in European weather data and how you can best utilize the information you've got and a host of other topics designed to help attendees leverage their skills. As weather trading takes its place in the online world, there is a pressing need to develop greater use of weather derivatives from corporations to avoid the market becoming a predominantly speculative industry.

During this time Northwest will have no access toClay Basin.  Additionally, Transwestern Pipeline has announced that its LaPlata Compressor facilities will be shut in from April 2 through April 5,2002, and will accept no deliveries from Northwest Pipeline.During the month of March north flow volumes through the Kemmerer compressorhave exceeded capacity on a regular basis.  With Clay Basin shut in,Northwest's balancing flexibility will be significantly impaired.  Northwestwill have no place to inject excess gas south of Kemmerer and as a resultcannot physically accommodate overscheduled volumes.If north flow volumes continue to exceed Kemmerer capacity during theQuestar and Transwestern maintenance, Northwest will take the followingsteps to maintain the reliability and integrity of its system: reduce linepack on the south end of its system prior to the maintenance; cutnorth-flowing alternate gas at compressor station cut points from La Platato Meacham as necessary to mitigate high line pressures or overschedulingthrough Kemmerer; take all necessary steps to ensure that gas deliveriesfrom receipt points south of the Meacham compressor closely approximateconfirmed nominations;  entitle for undertakes or overtakes, as appropriate;and finally, if required, Northwest will issue operational flow orders.If net scheduled volumes north through Northwest's Kemmerer Compressor donot exceed physical capacity, Northwest will have much greater flexibilityduring the Clay Basin and Transwestern shut-ins.  Northwest's customers canhelp themselves and reduce the likelihood that Kemmerer will overschedule bysecuring adequate gas from Canadian suppliers or by using their JacksonPrairie storage during this work.Northwest will make every effort to reduce the impact on its customers ofthe Clay Basin and Transwestern shut-ins and will be monitoring thesituation closely.  Northwest will take every opportunity to relax systemrestrictions in later cycles if north flow volumes moderate.  Northwest isconfident that if its customers respond prudently, the impact of theTranswestern and Questar maintenance will be greatly reduced.If you have any questions, please contact your Marketing Servicesrepresentative.

Dear Tech Support,Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed aslowdown in the performance of flower and jewelry applications that hadoperated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition, Husband 1.0uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.9,and installedundesirable programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0.Conversation 8.0 no longer runs and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashesthe system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but tono avail. What can I do?Desperate> >---------------------------------------------------------------------Dear Desperate,First, keep in mind that Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package,while Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Install Tears 6.2 and enter thecommand <C:\ I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME>.Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Guilty 3.0 andFlowers 7.0. But remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default toGrumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very badprogram that will create Snoring Loudly.WAV files.DO NOT install Mother-in law 1.0 or reinstall another Boyfriendprogram. These are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have alimited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might considerbuying additional software to improve performance. I personally recommendHot Food 3.0 and Lingerie 6.9.Good luck.
