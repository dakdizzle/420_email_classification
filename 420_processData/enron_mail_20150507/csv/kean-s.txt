This isn't about a federal agency; this is about which approach will produce the best outcome for consumers and our message needs to be couched in those terms.  Obviously, our view is that FERC's approach, at least so far, appears most likely to produce the kind of market which will ensure reliable, secure and affordable power.  I like the "gerrymandering" message.  A process dependent on compromise (eg a legislative body like congress) is going to produce a "camel" and that won't work for customers.  Truth be told it was this same kind of compromised, political, consensus-building exercise which produced AB 1890 and the resulting debacle in California's energy market.

ICE announced 28 August that its new clearing house, the formerly the London Clearing House of the International Petroleum Exchange, would clear cash-settled U.S. oil swaps for West Texas Intermediate crude and U.S. natural gas swaps at the Henry Hub. Since both of these underlying products trade as futures contracts in the U.S., the derivative product traded on ICE is regulated as well. The fact that the futures trade on another exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange, is immaterial. The ICE said its London Clearing House has applied to the CFTC for recognition as a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO). Section 5b(d) of the Commodities Exchange, Act, as added by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (CFMA),  provides that DCOs shall be deemed to be registered under this section to the extent that the DCO clears agreements, contracts, or transactions for a board of trade that has been designated by the Commission as a contract market for such agreements, contracts, or transactions before the date of enactment of this section. This provision captures all futures clearing organizations that have ever cleared any futures contracts for designated contract markets before the CFMA became effective. DCOs of both traditional open outcry exchanges, as well as electronic-only exchanges, have been approved by the CFTC. Applications by the Intercontinental Exchange and Hedge Street, Inc., appear to be pending.  A CFTC official told Intellibridge that few applications to create DCOs have been submitted since the CFMA was signed. Sources:CFTC, <http://www.cftc.gov/dea/dearegistered_dco.htm>ICE, <https://www.intcx.com/pressaug01c.html> For more information on depletion rates, or to speak with an industry expert, contact Intellibridge Sr. VP Kelley Kenyan at (202) 298-6300 x.256 or kkenyan@Intellibridge.com.

He will wlso be pulling together a small group of Western Govs to meet with Pat Wood to discuss the negative impacts of FERCs refund and rate cap proceedings on Western power markets outside of California.  He has asked us for two things (which I believe Paul, Sue L and Janel are working on):Agenda and briefing paper we would propose for the Govs meeting with WoodA "white paper: describing the burdens placed on western markets as a result of the price cap and refund processes.Like most Western govs, Geringer has little tolerance for federal mandates but he is very well informed on energy issues, favors open markets and is very interested particularly in seeing the western power grid opened.

Key results included:		 1. Pennsylvania		 		 66		 2. Texas		 		 		 65		 3. New York		 		 		 64		 4. Maine		 		 		 62		 17. California		 		 		 34"These numbers underscore the importance of building a healthy foundation onwhich electric competition can grow," said Ken Malloy, CEO of the Center."While California's crisis has brought a lot of positive attention toPennsylvania's model, many customers in the Keystone State are returning totheir original utility suppliers.  It underscores how important it is to putthe right fundamentals in place if consumers and suppliers are to benefitover the long haul," Malloy said.In rankings that included all of North America, the province of Albertaactually would rank above all the states with a score of 68.The mid-year RED Index also found that 62% of states expressing an opinionindicated that their commission is not "less likely to take action on energyrestructuring as a result of the California crisis."CAEM is an independent, nonprofit, think tank based in Washington, DC whosemission is to promote an effective transition from the monopoly to thecompetitive model of regulation.For information about obtaining a copy of the RED Index, go to www.caem.org.For more information, please contact:Nancy Etkin at 703-532-6887 or netkin@caem.orgIf you do not wish to receive announcements from CAEM, please put "remove"in the subject line in a reply to this email.477

But given Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim.In short, little has changed since yesterday.Best,Jeff

It will be heard again tomorrow (perhaps beginning at 10 AM) , at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.  Most, including us, oppose unless significantly amended.The Wright (D) -Richman (R) bill (83XX)was heard in an "informational" hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be heard again tomorrow, at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.  From our perspective, this is the best bill out there yet, though it still has serious problems---it isn't available electronically yet, but should be tomorrow, and I'll distribute then.  The chances of the joint D-R bill being successful are slim, however, since it's up against the Speakers competing bill.  There is talk that the Speaker will try to negotiate with Wright/Richman tonight and include any agreement in his bill (82XX).The original version of the Governor's MOU bill sits in the Senate.  Most believe that Burton will put it up for a vote this week and it will fail.The Senate's version of the MOU (Sher-Peace-Kuehl) (78XX)came out today.  It will likely be heard in the committee tomorrow or the next day.  Notably, it kills Direct Access completely and makes Edison shareholders responsible for that portion of Edison's debt owed to suppliers.  In short, a very bad bill.Burton's 18XX, which would de-link the bond issuance (to pay back the General Fund) from the DWR contracts is likely to pass the Senate tomorrow or the next day.  Many--including Enron--support the bill (though we are supporting it behind the scenes).What people don't know:Whether there's the time or the will in the Assembly and Senate to achieve by Friday a single, comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his signature. Whether the Legislature would postpone its month-long recess if the Legislature hasn't finished a bill by Friday (most folks think they will not postpone).Whether it's true that, irrespective of the energy issue, the Legislature will fail to get the budget completed by Friday and therefore have to postpone their recess anyway, in which case they might continue to work on the energy legislation at the same time.Odds-makers still say it's better than 50-50 that the Legislature does not get the Edison bills done by Friday and leaves on on its 30-day vacation.Best,JeffSacramento is one goofy place.

New York, July 12 (Bloomberg) -- The New York MercantileExchange today began trading a futures contract for low-sulfurcoal, a fuel that President George W. Bush said will play a majorrole in meeting electricity demand over the next two decades.     The contract's debut came after prices for coal, consideredthe dirtiest of power-plant fuels, doubled in the past year, asdemand from power plants outstripped mine production. Coal forSeptember delivery opened at $42 a ton and settled at $40.75, as98 contracts were traded, exchange officials said.     ``We had a big run-up in coal prices this past winter,'' saidAndy Ozley, who buys coal for Atlanta-based Mirant Corp.'s sixcoal plants in New York, Illinois, Maryland and Virginia. ``Thiscontract affords us a way to mitigate our exposure'' to largeprice swings.     The Bush administration said in an energy policy report thisspring that coal would be the dominant fuel for electricitygeneration through 2020. Bush gave an added boost to the fuel whenhe retreated from a campaign pledge to restrict carbon dioxideemissions, implicated in global warming.     Coal plants are responsible for a third of the nation'scarbon dioxide emissions. They also produce sulfur dioxide, whichcauses acid rain, and nitrogen oxides, which cause smog.     The Nymex started the futures contract to give miningcompanies and utilities a way to hedge their risks in the $33billion coal market. Producers such as Peabody Energy Corp. andArch Coal Inc., whose shares have soared in the past year, havesaid they would trade the futures.                            New Plants     Last year's quadrupling of prices for natural gas -- acleaner-burning power-plant fuel -- prompted many generators toramp up output from their coal plants. Utility coal stockpilesdwindled, and prices have risen to their highest levels since atleast 1989.     So far this year, more than a dozen companies have announcedplans to build coal-fired plants, including Kansas City, Missouri-based Kansas City Power & Light Co. and Portland, Oregon-basedPacifiCorp.     Although coal is used to produce 52 percent of the nation'selectricity, few plants were built during the 1990s because of thehigh costs of building them and the difficulty of complying withfederal and local environmental regulations.     Demand for coal has eased in recent weeks as below-normaltemperatures in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast reduced demand forair conditioning, said Jim Parks, who buys coal for six powerplants in Ohio and Pennsylvania as director of fuels at Akron,Ohio-based FirstEnergy Corp.     ``The summer's been pretty mild so far -- you haven't seenany big heat waves'' in regions with the most coal generation, hesaid.                           Big Sandy     The Nymex futures contract calls for the delivery of 1,550tons of low-sulfur coal to the mouth of the Big Sandy River nearHuntington, West Virginia. From there, the fuel would be loadedonto Ohio River barges and shipped to power plants in the U.S. andpossibly Europe.     The new contract is tailored to producers in Appalachianstates that account for about 40 percent of U.S. production,including West Virginia, Kentucky and Pennsylvania, the No. 2, 3and 4 coal producers.     The industry lacks a futures contract for coal from Westernstates that account for 47 percent of the nation's production,including the No. 1 producer, Wyoming.                         Avoiding the Past     The exchange, which earns commissions on trades, hopes coalfutures will avoid the fate of other contracts it has started overthe past few years. Its six electricity futures contracts havefizzled, as has its Middle East sour crude oil contract, whichdebuted in May 2000.     ``I said yesterday, if you traded 100 to 200 contracts, thatwould be a really a good day,'' said Chris Casale, vice presidentof energy trading at Dynegy Inc. in Houston, which trades coal andbuys the fuel for its six power plants in New York and Illinois.``It came out sort of on target.''     Most of today's trading was originated by large energymarketing companies, he said, although he declined to say whetherDynegy traded any contracts. Enron Corp., the largest energytrader, and Duke Energy Corp., the largest U.S.-based utilityholding company, have said they would trade coal futures.     Exchange officials have said the coal market has thepotential to reach 5,000 trades a day after a year of trading.     The Nymex's 17-year-old crude oil futures contract averagesabout 66,700 trades a day, and its 11-year-old natural gascontract averages about 33,500.                           Wary of Coal     ``The coal market is still lacking liquidity,'' said AnthonyMcAuley, a floor broker at ABN Amro Inc., who said he bought fivecoal contracts for a client at $42 a ton -- the market's firsttransaction. ``You probably need to see a little moreparticipation'' from industry coal buyers and sellers for themarket to take off.

By Michelle Martinez Arjona, Editor-in-Chief, =and Paul Hohl, Contributing Editor  These days, saying the word "Enron" in =a room full of metals executives is like screaming "fire" in a crowded thea=ter. For most in the steel industry, the idea of a futures market is enough= to raise a few eyebrows. But when a major market maker with annual revenue=s of 10 times the market cap of the U.S. steelmaking industry stakes a clai=m (for 2000 alone, Enron logged revenues of $101 billion--that's with a "b"=), a lot more than eyebrows are likely to be raised. After a bold presentat=ion from Jeff McMahon, president and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets, at th=e SSCI annual convention in May (in which he accused steel mills of treatin=g their service center customers as "annoyances"), industry leaders rushed =to understand this latest market contender.  Friend or foe? Competitor or p=artner? These are just a couple of the questions surrounding Enron's aggres=sive push into the metals industry. Judging from the service center and mil=l executives Modern Metals queried, there are as many answers as there are =opinions in the industry. Reactions ranged from fear to acceptance to downr=ight resentment. At least one mill was reticent to discuss Enron at all--st=ill others seemed to meet the issue with unaffected shrugs. If the saying i=s true that all publicity is good publicity, the buzz that Enron has genera=ted would make even a Hollywood spin doctor envious. What's the hubbub? Alt=hough products such as natural gas and energy--Enron's major business platf=orm--have been traded as commodities for years, until Enron's appearance a =formal forward market for steel has never existed. According to McMahon, th=e absence of a liquid and transparent market has resulted in "uninformed in=vestment decisions" that have exacerbated the current oversupply situation,= and left companies exposed to the hazards of price volatility.  Enron's an=swer is to offer a variety of financial hedging products along with forward= contracts in hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized (plate and long produc=ts are soon to follow), locking in prices for as many as five years out. En=ron contends that it can act as a "risk intermediary" in steel transactions=, ensuring healthier profit margins and lowering the cost of capital. Certa=in grades of steel are commodities, McMahon insists, and as such should be =bought and sold on a commodity market basis, instead of the strategic relat=ionships that now exist between the mills and consumers. Enron has been off=ering steel online, and via phone and fax, since November of last year. "Be=fore you add capacity, before you make an investment decision, you'll be ab=le to see a three, five, maybe even a 10-year forward price of steel," McMa=hon stated, "and if you want to hedge that investment you can do that." The= company plans to buy steel at a floating price and then sell it to steel c=onsumers at a fixed rate, making money on the spread. In February, Greg Her=mans, VP of steel trading at Enron, reported to AMM that it was offering U.=S.-made 10-gauge, 48-in. wide hot-rolled for April delivery in Chicago for =$225 a ton. Hermans said Enron was buying the same product for April delive=ry at $215 a ton.  Eventually, Enron sees the development of four different= marketplaces: the Northeast, the Midwest (or Chicago area), the Gulf Coast= (or Houston area), and the West Coast. Enron will hedge against spot price= spikes through equity and physical holdings in domestic mills. The company= closed on Huntco's Arkansas-based cold-rolling mill in June. "It's a big p=ortfolio," McMahon said. "We wanted to put together a portfolio of supply a=nd demand. In some cases, we'll own assets--hopefully we'll own some term c=ontracts with domestic mills. To the extent that imports are a part of the =equation, we'll be a part of that market. We may purchase capacity from som=ebody, not necessarily the assets, but toll slab through a hot strip mill. =All of those combined is how we do our business." Steel mills can benefit, =McMahon said, by entering into a multi-year "physical off take" with Enron,= thus giving steel mills a degree of certain volume and on product specific=ation. Enron would guarantee purchase of a specified amount of tonnage, and= use a floating price or a floor price to guard against market shocks. Whet=her mills would be willing to divert capacity to the commodity grades being= bought and sold by Enron remains uncertain. At least one mill executive pr=ivately said no . . . at least for now. Nucor president, CEO and vice chair=man, Dan DiMicco also sees little value in Enron's proposal. "What we need =to have is stable pricing at levels where the most efficient mills can make= a good return on their capital and further invest in new technologies and =equipment," he stated. "I define true value as helping the industry to beco=me stronger. It doesn't do any good to maintain a lack of price volatility =at $200 a ton." Keith Busse, CEO at Steel Dynamics, echoed that sentiment i=n a recent New Steel article. "If you're trying to get volatility out at $3=20 [per ton], great," he said. "But at $230, you want to stick your fingers= down your throat." For the service centers Service centers, McMahon sugges=ted, could benefit immediately. "The only way [distributors] are able to he=dge themselves is to go out and buy inventory," he explained. "That takes c=apital, and cash, and space. We can offer a financial product that gives th=e exact same protection, but doesn't require any of the above. "We can hold= those inventories and price the steel at the time of delivery to the servi=ce centers," he continued, "so their 4- or 5- percent net margins are somew=hat certain." "I do think that Enron is providing a service for the industr=y . . . " commented Dave Lerman, CEO of Steel Warehouse, South Bend, Indian=a. But he pointed out that "how [it] moves forward will be interesting. If =they just move forward with hedge instruments . . . that's independent of w=hether you run your business well by having a good supplier that matches up= with the demands of your customers. I think [Enron] will be a good thing f=or some people and a non-event for others." Beyond hedging, McMahon pointed= out, firm and enforceable contracts could become a key benefit to service =centers. As one Midwestern distributor source commented, "One of the terrib=le things that happens in our business is that end users demand long-term p=ricing, beyond what anybody can foresee. When they anticipate the market is= going up, or that it has hit a low point, they push harder for it--as any =one would. But historically, they don't honor the deals."  In a down market=, he explained, customers demand lower prices. Noncompliance can result in =orders, but no releases, and a "don't call us, we'll call you" attitude fro=m customers. The consequence for service centers, he said, are price reduct=ions on the way down and on the way up. "If Enron brings integrity to both =sides of this market," he concluded, "that would be a very big plus for the= steel industry." But integrity, another Midwest service center exec counte=red, has got nothing to do with it. In his estimation, Enron is like a prof=iteering carpetbagger, "trying to make a buck in between the producer and t=he user. That's all we need right now," he declared, "somebody trying to sq=ueeze out a few more dollars." But, he recognized, "we're all going to have= to deal with it." Don McNeeley, president and CEO of Chicago Tube & Iron, =indicated that some good could come of a heavy-hitter like Enron introducin=g new ideas into the industry, but acknowledged that people might be offend=ed by somebody picking the so-called "low-hanging fruit" of the steel marke=t in the current economy. "What do you think the mills are going to do when= you come to them for just the peripheral items?" he queried. "My concern w=ould be that the price would go up on [those items]." McNeeley also questio=ned the wisdom of distributors relinquishing control of their inventories. ="In distribution, 60 percent of our net worth is inventory, 30 percent is a=ccounts receivable, and 10 percent is plant property and equipment," he rel=ated. "Our single largest asset is our inventory. If a distribution company= surrenders control of its inventory to a third party, does not that distri=butor, in effect, surrender its own sovereignty?" Only just begun Questions= abound regarding Enron's role as a physical supplier of steel as well. As =one Minnesota-based service center exec put it, "are they ready to deal wit=h problems?" Although Enron has expressed interest in being a physical supp=lier, Dave Lerman explained, "I think that's going to be a lot more difficu=lt to implement." Enron would have to consider specific qualities, coil siz=es, nuances of chemistry, surface quality, and formability. "Most customers= require better than standard tolerances," he pointed out. "These are all i=ssues that might complicate commodity sales." Delivery is another issue. As= a physical supplier, Enron has virtually guaranteed just-in-time delivery,= but as one service center source said, "the guarantee is good when the mat=erial shows up at my door. What happens if it doesn't show up? I disappoint= a customer. What good does it do to sue [Enron] if I've lost a customer?" =Mill executives have questioned whether Enron is a potential competitor. "T=hey see Enron as someone likely to buy foreign steel in order to deliver it= to a U.S. customer," said Chuck Bradford, principal of Bradford Research a=nd a long-time industry observer. He cautioned against seeing Enron as too =much of a physical supplier, speculating that the future of Enron, similar =to the LME, will be in hedging. "You may see some [physical transactions] t=o start with," Bradford predicted, "just to get the ball rolling. But I don='t see that as the way the market will develop." McMahon has been consisten=t in saying that Enron has little interest in becoming a steel manufacturer=. The real value, he said, is in a transparent, liquid market. "We know the= products work, we know the market wants them. Can any one particular mill =or mills prevent that? We don't think so," he said. "It's not an 'if', it's= a 'when'." The jury is still out on just how soon that "when" will come, a=nd what those effects will be for the steel industry. And for all of the de=bate surrounding the issue, it seems a bit soon to be hitting the panic but=ton. As Don McNeeley recounted, "I can recall similar controversy over a sp=eech a guy gave about 15-17 years ago. That guy's name was Ken Iverson, and= he had this concept called a mini-mill. Look at it now." =09

The document is still too rough to send out.  We need to take the opportunity, as soon as possible, to get a hard hitting, thoroughly researched and carefully written document in front of the Commissioners.  California's reaction to the Judge's recommendation is likely to give FERC (especially the new commissioners) a feel for how irrational the California politicians can be.  We will have a limited opportunity to take advantage of that realization.  We need to hit it hard in the pleading, our conversations at the Commission, the Hill and the media.

A couple of comments for your consideration:On page three we describe the change to the definition of Public Utility an=d then argue that we don't fit into it.  Would it be worth explaining why t=hat makes sense?  Specifically, the New Jersey restructuring law, like most= efforts of its kind in other markets, is designed to separate the competit=ive from monopoly elements of the power (and gas) businesses.  Economic reg=ulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the =business (eg distribution).  The competitive market can not be solely relie=d upon to "regulate" the behavior of monopoly asset owners, such as distrib=ution utilities.  Therefore, regulators continue to be called upon to set p=ricing and other terms of service.  What those regulators decide matters a =great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for =lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign c=ontributions to tacitly influence decision makers.  The same public policie=s simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive.  =The generation and sales business has a competitive structure (i.e. relativ=ely low barriers to entry, multiple competitors etc.).  These components of= the power and gas business can be "regulated" by the market with respect t=o rates and terms of service.  They do not require economic regulation any =more than grocery stores, department stores, appliance sellers or other "re=tailers" (who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions.  Com=petition and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices a=nd terms of service.  Because regulators don't set the prices and terms of =service for such sellers, there is no reason to be concerned about campaign= contribuitions from such organizations.  Indeed, the legislation, and the =legislative history, clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale.As a former practicing lawyer, I certainly understand the value of pleading= in the alternative.  But, I question how certain of our arguments woud be =perceived by the public if they ever came to light (which these documents h=ave a habit of doing).. .  I can just see the press seizing on Enron's clai=m of "ignorance or mistake" or the fact that we pled for the favorable exer=cise of "prosecutorial discretion".  I suggest that we add whatever we feel= is necessary to the very solid looking intent argument, not make specific =reference to "ignorance or mistake", and not plead for the favorable esxerc=ise of PD.  If we feel we need to write about this last item, perhaps we co=uld suggest that it would be a waste of the public's resources to pursue a =claim under such circumstances.

My impression is that our commendable efforts to= build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get-togethers that= require substantial travel.  Our challenge is that such gatherings are far= more costly and time-consuming for us to attend than our Houston colleague=s might realize.  Often, participating in these meetings takes an entire we=ek for Enron Europe employees (especially if they are outside of Texas). Na=turally, they may feel that this time of year (PRC time) is exactly the wro=ng time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering.These off-sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter, which comp=ounds the difficulty; worse still are the times they occur at the end of Q2=, since it also coincides and conflicts with the PRC process.I would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the tra=vel time and costs (both direct and indirect) when inviting international e=mployees to off-site meetings in the US.  We appreciate the chance to be in=cluded in the broader Enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizat=ions, but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expe=nses.Thanks!John Sherriff(Letter sent to all Enron Europe VPs and direct reports)We still have issues regarding Offsites and 'Team Building' exercises.  In =particular, we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform =other key work groups when workplace absences are pending.In order to avoid misunderstandings, and to increase transparency, the foll=owing will apply with immediate effect:Any Offsite or 'Team Building' exercise which any group (both commercial an=d non-commercial, and including John and myself)intends to undertake must b=e communicated, in advance, to all department heads. Issue to be identified= include:  all participants who will out of the office, total costs of the =exercise; and, where appropriate, work load coverage details.John and I are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefe=r that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends. To the extent that= is not possible, we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work= is appropriately covered.Trips to Houston and especially resorts in the US are far more difficult to= justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved.  So pleas=e pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel.Please communicate this policy to your staff.Michael Brown

Each mile that electrici=ty must be transmitted adds to the overall cost.=20"No one's going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps," said= Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an e=nergy-industry association in Menlo Park.=20Ackerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was =no economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price cont=rols are in effect.=20"This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up no=t having enough," Ackerman said. "It increases the threat of blackouts."=20BLACKOUT ALERT CANCELEDCalifornia authorities issued a blackout alert at 1:45 p.m. yesterday when =power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels. They canceled the alert ab=out an hour later, after finding additional supplies.=20"Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts," said Stephanie McCorkle, =a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which oversee=s the state's power network.=20The Golden State's latest brush with lights-out conditions came a day after= Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time, prompting= heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their li=ghts.=20Don Soderberg, chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission, said tha=t the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that th=ey are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had= in exacerbating Monday's shortage.=20"We're looking very closely at this," he said. "There seems to be a potenti=al for unintended consequences."=20Specifically, Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older, less=- efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking, if not vanishin=g, under capped prices.=20"We're going to see how the caps might have played into this," he said.=20The federal ceiling in 10 Western states, excluding California, is about $9=2 per megawatt hour. In California, a 10 percent surcharge is added because= of the state's credit risk, bringing the price to just over $101.=20Ackerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls ha=ve extended California's power crisis to neighboring states.=20"California sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus," he said.==20'LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES'=20California and Nevada officials, however, said that they still have faith t=hat price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federal= regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot wit=hhold output.=20"The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes (in the plan),"= said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources.=20Unfortunately, it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue= that they took up only with the greatest reluctance.

The department buys electricity fo=r the state's financially distressed utilities.=20"They didn't understand what they were going to be paid; there was confusio=n over the FERC order," Hidalgo said. "We saw 1,500 megawatts disappear."==20The problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West, which forced Ca=lifornia to compete with other states for scarce electricity, he said. Roll=ing blackouts hit southern Nevada.=20Most California officials credit the FERC system, which is based on a varia=ble price cap, with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power mark=et. But power generators have complained that the price caps, by limiting p=rofits, could discourage the production of critically needed electricity. A=nd as Monday's episode suggested, even the uncertainty about where the cap =will fall could lead to unexpected shortages.=20"That's the risk that you run (with price controls)," said Arthur O'Donnell=, editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets. "People want any kind= of certainty at all."=20Hidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last-minute import=s from the Bonne=07ville Power Administration, the federal agency that mark=ets government-produced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest. The s=tate went into a Stage 2 power alert, the next-to-last level before blackou=ts are ordered. The alert was canceled in late afternoon.=20The blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8.=20FERC imposed a round-the-clock ceiling on power throughout the West. The pr=ice fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the least-efficient p=lant operating in California during a "power alert" declared by the Indepen=dent System Operator, which runs the state's power-transmission grid. When =there's no alert, prices can't exceed 85 percent of the cap that was establ=ished during the latest alert.=20Until Monday, the maximum price held steady at about $101 a megawatt-hour i=n California. But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early afte=rnoon, signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7 percent= of demand, confusion set in, Hidalgo and others said.=20Because of a steep drop in the price of natural gas, which fuels many Calif=ornia power plants, suppliers knew the cap would fall. But no one knew by h=ow much until the price was posted by the ISO.=20The ceiling for California fell to about $77 at 3 p.m. but was back up to $=98 in two hours, according to the ISO. Those prices include the 10 percent =premium that sellers can charge California because FERC said there's a cred=it risk in selling to the state.=20O'Donnell said it's likely suppliers will pull back from the market every t=ime the ISO declares a power alert.=20In-state generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO. Bu=t out-of-state suppliers can withhold supplies, and on Monday it was the ou=t-of-staters that were pulling back, Hidalgo said.=20The Bee's Dale Kasler can be reached at (916) 321-1066 or dkasler@sacbee.co=m .=20Power Sales Halted by New Pricing Curbs=20Electricity: Confused suppliers, unsure what they will be paid, refuse to s=ell to state, which asks FERC for a ruling but doesn't get it.=20By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer=20     SACRAMENTO--Confusion over new federal price restrictions prompted sev=eral electricity sellers to back away from sales to California on Monday af=ternoon, pushing the state closer to blackouts, energy officials said.     The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to su=pply more than 1 million homes, said Ray Hart, deputy director of the Calif=ornia Department of Water Resources, which has been buying much of the stat=e's electricity since January.     At least five companies producing or marketing power "are telling us t=hat since they don't know what they're going to get paid, they're not going= to take the risk, and so they're not going to sell the energy," Hart said.     The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in s=ummer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage 1 emergency, m=eaning reserves had dipped below 7%. It was the first such emergency since =May 31.     Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission inte=nded to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West, a power e=mergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that appli=es to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona.=20     The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run th=e most inefficient, expensive power plant selling electricity to California= grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency.     But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price =is supposed to be established under the commission's order, and that appare=ntly drove away sellers, Hart said.     Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 1:30 p.m., putting= the old price limit of $90 per megawatt-hour in question, companies that h=ad committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon= backed out, Hart said. The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of= Oregon, Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading, a unit= of the San Diego-based energy conglomerate.     Forced to dip even deeper into the state's power reserves and declare =a Stage 2 emergency, water agency officials called the federal energy commi=ssion's hotline for clarification about what the new price should be and wh=en it should take effect. They got no answer.     Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to clar=ify their order today. One outstanding question is what obligations power s=uppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergency.     Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price, when i=t is set, will probably be lower than $90 per megawatt-hour because the pri=ce of natural gas, the main fuel in California power plants, has dropped la=tely.     Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators =had anticipated. But they said they expected to avoid rolling blackouts in =part because the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland, Ore., had agr=eed to provide several hundred megawatts of Pacific Northwest hydropower ea=ch hour in exchange for a return of electricity from California later this =summer.     "Bonneville is giving us emergency power to get us through," Hart said=.=20Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times=20James D Steffes07/06/2001 10:04 PMTo:=09Jeffrey T Hodge/Enron@EnronXGate, Robert C Williams/Enron@EnronXGatecc:=09Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Linda R=obertson/NA/Enron@ENRON, Alan Comnes/Enron@EnronXGate, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enr=on@Enron, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron, Robert Frank/NA/Enron@Enron, Ray Alvarez/N=A/Enron@ENRON, Sarah Novosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, dwatkiss@bracepatt.com=20Subject:=09ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGDE - Draft FERC Brief on Settlement Proc=essThe attached is a rough draft of a potential filing Enron would make in to =Judge Wagner in the Settlement process (it is unclear if this would remain =confidential per the gag order).Please provide Ray Alvarez your comments.

Once provisioned, these resourcesremain digitally connected to each person as they move through the businesscycle and are dynamically updated as necessary. At the appropriate time,they are systematically, securely and automatically removed.  Organizations that employ eProvisioning gain a competitive edge and accesscomplete security by ensuring that people are kept productive from day one,and are prevented from becoming counterproductive beyond the day they leave.In addition, by aligning their IT infrastructure with business priorities,organizations can effectively manage change across the extended enterprise,and better respond to emerging market requirements. eProvision Day One provides business and IT executives with the ability toquickly identify bottlenecks and maintain accountability of theeProvisioning process through comprehensive reporting and trackingcapabilities.

Pharmaceuticals were included because Ken sits on Lilly's board and wanted a closer look at that sector.

The HR organization has been working to develop meaningful reporting of trends in our employee population.  A few highlights from this report:The employee base continues to grow (though on a significantly slower pace than 2000).Terminations (voluntary and involuntary) are up dramatically this year.Our "contribution loss" (a statistic which uses terminations weighted by the performance ratings of those leaving) has gone up, indicating that we are losing more high performers than in previous periods.  However, those departures of high performers are concentrated in areas of substantial reorganizations (EBS, the former EE&CC and HPL).Let us know if you would like to see additional items on the report or if you have questions about the data.

KeanExecutive Vice President and Chief of StaffEnron Corp.It's hard to tell what motivates Paul Krugman's frequent attacks on Enron (="Enron Goes Overboard" August 17).  His latest attack is no more than a str=ing of misstatements and non-sequitors reminiscent of a schoolyard taunt.  =He reveals, in depth, his ignorance of Enron, the people who work here, and= the tragically botched California regulatory regime.  Perhaps he seeks mer=ely to entertain.=09The broader goal of his personal attack appears to be to discredit the f=ree market system - a system that entrusts people to make choices and enjoy= the fruits of their labor, skill, intellect, and heart. He would apparentl=y rely on a system of government controlled or sponsored monopolies to make= choices for people.  We disagree, finding ourselves less trusting of the i=ntegrity and good faith of such institutions and their leaders.  Ironically=, the example Krugman cites of "financialization" run amok (the electricity= market in California) is the product of exactly his kind of system, with a=ctive government intervention at every step.  Indeed, the only winners in t=he entire California fiasco were the government owned utilities of Los Ange=les, the Pacific Northwest, and British Columbia.  The disaster that squand=ered the wealth of California was born of regulation by the few, not by mar=kets of the many.

Additionally there has been a substantial amount of restructuring in both EBS and in EES to reduce costs and refocus our business on high value opportunities.  As Ken has said, though, the basic business model and strategy of Enron is sound and promises continued growth -- no changes there.  For example, in the Enron Industrial Markets and Enron Global Markets groups -- efforts begun just over a year ago -- we have already experienced enormous volume and revenue growth and we are making money already in these "first mover" businesses.  Successes like these prove the advantages of our overall strategy and business model.  Combined with some long overdue focus on costs, we should be well on our way to even greater gains in recurring earnings.

Can we opt not to have a severance plan and simply handle matters on a case-by-case basis (perhaps with "rule of thumb" guidelines)?If we are required to have such a plan, should we centrally administer the plan to avoid inconsistencies?My original message regarding the employee involved was raising a somewhat broader concern.  Perhaps because our plans are complicated, we have had occasions where an employee was told something, what he/she was told was incorrect, he/she changed position based on what he/she was told, and then we made the employee bear the risk of the mistake.  Obviously, the right answer is to get it right the first time, but on those occasions where we made the mistake, do we have the flexibility to fix it?

We can probably find a better tool than a survey to get at that infromation.  I'm not opposed to including those questions if you think we will get useful data, but I raise the issue in case there are other questions you mihgt want to ask but didn't have time for.  I don't think we will be able to categorize customers in terms of whether they are lapsed, current or prospective.  That information is kept on an inconsistent and decentralized basis in the company.Finally, given Enron's focus on the day-to-day, I wouldn't count to heavily on getting alot of help putting together the stakeholder sample.  You should have a back-up plan.Thanks for the opportunity to comment.  I am very much looking forward to reviewing the results.

rkean@starband.net,rkean@starband.net,rkean@starband.net,Subject: RE: Ethanol,I'm not sure.  A couple of theories:  refining capacity is limited because of environmental barriers to new refinery construction;  second, in the absence of government subsidies I think ethanol is uneconomic (and with continued low crude prices and an antisubsidy mentality in Washington, it's unlikely to get better soon). In other news:  Melissa's mom called last night.  Francis is dying.  He was slowly going with congestive heart failure and now has renal cancer which has spread to his liver.  He has had a great life and is well into his nineties.  He is mostly sleeping now and Norma will be getting a hospice nurse today.  Norma seems fine (this has been coming for a while), but of course no one is ever ready.  He has stayed himself to the end:  when Norma was helping him get back in bed after he had fallen, he told her:  "I don't think we"ll be having sex today."

kenneth.lay@enron.com,kenneth.lay@enron.com,kenneth.lay@enron.com,Subject: ,X-FileName: SKEAN (Non-Privileged).pstSome background information for the meeting with Mayor Brown:Brown won 43% of the vote (to Sanchez' 40%) and is now in a run off with Sanchez.  Sue Walden's perspective, not surprisingly, is that Brown will win and that campaign polls show him ahead among likely voters.  African American turnout in the election was lower than expected, but an active get-out-the-vote campaign could turn that around.Enron has supported the mayor with a $10,000 contribution.  I would not recommend a further commitment under the current circumstances.If you want to discuss some of the positive accomplishments of his administration, you could:Congratulate him on passage of his version of the light rail proposition.Compliment him on how he has responded to security issues since Sept 11 and his handling of flood relief.(You should know that the Houston police were extremely helpful and responsive when we asked for assistance in connection with the October 26 threat to the Enron building.)We have responded to the City's RFP for energy service.EES made a presentation last week proposing a 5-7 year transactionThe city is opting for a 1-2 year transactionThat would require very detailed load data which is in Reliant's possession.We have expressed concern that we are merely a stalking horse in the city's effort to do a deal with Reliant.  We have said that we won't play on those terms.Separately, we are working with the city on a demand side deal.

Ken urged him to stay for the meeting (not clear if he will).I got the impression from Ken that part of the reason Barton is not sending the letter is that he thinks he will be passing a bill anyway (not necessarily that he disagrees with the substance of the letter).

These actions are important to preserving the value of what Dynegy is buying.  The merger agreement, of course, has a "no shop" provision, and it has provisions, as I understand it, to make sure Enron continues to run the business prudently. That's what we are doing.

The phone option (with the keying in of each letter) looks very complicated but I'm not sure that there is a better way to do it (it will probably just encourage more people to make their elections online).The message from Ken about increasing costs should be modified, I think.  First, I think we may be overstating it to say that the cost increases for future periods threaten the health of the company  ... I know it's a play on the "health" theme, but I think it comes off as unnecessarily alarmist.  Second, and on a related point, I think we should be a bit clearer that we can't keep this up and absent some major change in the underlying cost of health care we are likely to increase the employee contribution in "03 and beyond.  Finally, I think Greg Whalley and Mark Frevert should see this part of the message at least (after we make changes).Again, I think this is a very good communications piece.  Nice work.
