vbrawne@nicor.com,vbrawne@nicor.com,vbrawne@nicor.com,Subject: RE: Good Morning  :),Hey Pooky,The rest of the weekend was fine.  I forgot to tell you on Saturday night about our choir's performance at this community function we had.  In fact, I was on my way home when you and I were talking.  Sometimes our choir members are so sad, they don't always show up at functions and events like they should, unless its an opportunity to showboat.  So.....I had to sing on the front row on Saturday evening.  We sounded like crap....I was so embarassed, I actually got so hot and started sweating, because of my embarassment.  It was awful.  I just thought about that when your e-mail arrived.  Kendall was very whinny and cried alot yesterday, I actually thought he might be getting sick, because that was so out of character for him, but he's back to his old self now, just talking alot and being hard-headed.I just called the lawyer again and got the secretary....she said that she had been out sick with pneumonia and the attorney had some major oral surgery, so she could not talk....so I'll give this firm the benefit of the doubt.  The secretary said she would have her call me back shortly or at least the secretary would call me and let me know.So "F" is starting to feel the effects of his years of dishing out dirt.  I hate that it hurts, but most men do end up regretting their previous behavior.  I know what you mean about your Dad.  In my case, my dad would be saying, hold on....Anyway, I love you too and can't wait to see where we both go from here.....

I really like what I'm doing.  My  boys are getting the added benefit of Mom being in a really good mood most of the time.  Jordan is doing pretty good in school,  I'm not really sure that he's in love with school, but he's doing well.   Kendall, what can I say?  My Kendall is something else.  He is so funny, and guess what, he talks in a very loud voice, it kills me, i wonder where he got that from!Suzy is moving to New York this Friday morning.  Her husband's mom lives somewhere in New York and they will be moving there so that he can hopefully find a job.  I hate to see her go, but if it's best for there family, then go for it.Anyway, take careLove ya!

These prices are by no means, what we specifically charged at the time, but should give you an idea if this pricing is more competitive than the prices you have received in the past.  These prices also assume that you purchased gas at the First of the Month Index.  Please keep in mind that these sales prices are for deliveries to the Nipsco City gate, and you will need to find out what Nipsco will charge you to transport the gas from the city gate to your burner tip.  If my memory serves me, I believe you indicated that you were buying your gas directly from Nipsco, and if that is the case, then we will be comparing "apples to apples".January, 2001			$10.99February, 2001			$  6.61Mar, 2001			$  5.38Apr. 2001			$  5.70May, 2001			$  5.13June, 2001			$  3.95July, 2001			$  3.40August, 2001			$  3.25September, 2001		$  2.42October, 2001			$  2.00I still need to find out from you what type of volume you will need on a daily basis.

pmonaghan@csnllc.com,pmonaghan@csnllc.com,pmonaghan@csnllc.com,Subject: RE: Heartland Steel/CSN,Hey Pat,I've done some research on the actuals that you make reference to (Vectren).Enron's sale with Heartland Steel is at the interconnect between Midwestern Gas Transmission and Vectren (formerly know as Indiana Gas).  The actual volumes that you are reporting and consider to be your monthly actuals are volumes that I believe are behind Vectren's city gate (which means that you more than likely have an imbalance on Vectren's system).  This bears checking with Vectren, regarding an imbalance behind their gate.  You should be receiving some type of statement or invoice from Vectren.Per the contract, Enron uses the Midwestern Gas Transmission (pipeline statement) to actualize our monthly invoices to you.I've attempted to draw a diagram for you to make it as clear as I can.Let's talk!_________________________________________XXXX_______________________________________________________________________________XXX Midwestern Gas Pipeline                            Interconnect b/t Vectren                 (this pipe owned by Vectren)                                       Heartland Steel Facility	                                                    & Midwestern Gas Pipeline	                                                                                           (Burner Tip)

We went to the dreaded "Chuckee Cheese" this weekend and oh boy, was I ever glad to get out of there.  After that, we went  to the Galleria, because when I was there before without them, I saw a shoe store that had really cute, fashionable shoes for little boys.  What I didn't realize was that they were designer shoes.  Who ever heard of Kenneth Cole shoes for little boys.  $65 a pair for the kind that I liked.  But since I was there, I said, what the heck?  After about 20 minutes, we had been waited on, but still neither one of my boys had even tried on a pair of shoes yet, let alone buying a pair (the sales folks were truly taking their sweet time).  I was pissed and me and my possee (Jordan and Kendall) almost "set if off" at the Galleria.  We just left after I told them that their service was unacceptable.

I have contacted your legal counsel, Mr. Tarter, and obtained information that will hopefully satisfy Enron's request.  The next step for me is to meet with my legal staff on Monday, October 15, 2001 to determine the following:1) Is the relationship between Heartland Steel and Enron completely severed?2) Do we come up with a brand new pricing and deal structure with CSN, or does the existing structure with Heartland Steel remain in place?Once, these determinations have been made, we'll follow up with the necessary legal documents.I'm hoping to have resolution to these entire process by early next week.Talk to you then.P.S. As a notional indicator, November, 2001 pricing for Chicago city gate delivered volume (which is comparable to your location) would be estimated at NYMEX (currently $2.41) plus approximately $0.10.Please keep in mind that the NYMEX price changes on a second-by-second basis, and this will impact your price.

We are now getting calls from a representative of CSN (Companhia Sidergica Nacional, LLC) saying that they have purchased Heartland Steel effective July, 2001.  If this is the case, then why are we continuing to invoice Heartland Steel?  Have we been paid by Heartland Steel?  Have we been continuing to receive the prepayments, and if so from whom?  Has CSN assumed the contractual obligations of Heartland Steel?While the credit risk is not my responsibility, I am, however, extremely concerned that we really do not have a firm handle on the identity of our actual counterparty.Will you please let me know how we should proceed.  I have a call into the CSN representative and it appears that they are not really happy with us, and would like to receive a visit from an Enron representative.Let me know what the game plan is by noon, Friday, September 28, 2001.Thank you for your cooperation.

BP states they need to have the volumes/contractnumber information back from Enron via e-mail by 9:45am MST in order toplace nominations by 10:30am MST for the Timely Cycle. If for whateverreason Enron cannot provide the volume/contract number information by9:45am or Enron fails to take the scheduled volume agreed to at 9:00am; andBP incurs any penalty costs including the price difference between theEnron price and the replacement price, then Enron should be liable forthese costs NOT Gulf. I suggest the following options:1) Put back in the default contract number in the Enron/Crestar agreementas we had last week, this way if Enron fails to notify by 9:45am, thenCrestar/BP can nominate to the default contract number and Enron can changethe contract numbers internally.2) Add a clause to either the Enron agreement or the Gulf assignmentagreement to state if Enron fails to inform and/or take, then any penaltycosts/price difference incurred by Crestar/BP shall be passed onto Enron.Please advise what Enron's position is and how we should proceed.------Bruce KohrsPhone: (403)205-7684Fax: (403)266-1947e-mail:bruce_kohrs@keyspancanada.com

He said that everything was okay financially  for the future, and they only had an immediate need for the tax money.  He sounded okay with me asking about it.  He even said "You are so sweet with words".He just doesn't realize, but we get that ability from him.How was your weekend, mine was good, we spent alot of time outside.  We went to the B-Day party and the kids bowled and boy did Kendall love bowling.  In fact Jordan, ny athletic one, bowled a strike.  They call it bumper bowling because they put up little bumpers.  All the kids enjoyed it so much, Natasha and I are going to take the kids back in a couple of weeks and let them bowl one day after we get off work.  Bowling alleys notoriously have good food.  Yesterday, we went to the park and spent several hours outside, it was like in the low 80's yesterday.  I'm glad daylight savings time is here, its so nice to be able to get home and get things taken care of before it gets dark.This morning, I went to drop the kids off at the daycare at 6:30 a.m. (mind you, I'm running about 10  minutes late) and the daycare teacher (the wife of one of Todd's good friends) that opens up the facility (she's the only one with a key) was late again.  Now the heffa was late one day last week and I didn't say anything, beccause everyone is late every once in awhile, but she made me late for work last week.  So...I blew up this morning and had to leave the kids standing in the parking lot with about 3 other teachers and 6 other parents with their kids.  I want to call up their and complain, but I think I'll talk with her first (maybe!)    She needs to get her stuff together, because first thing in the morning is not a time to play with folks.Talk with you later

I spoke with Daddy yesterday and told him to sit his butt down and stop trying to go to work, especially if there are no health benefits that he will be losing.  Instead of concentrating on that job, I told him to concentrate on his health.  He said I was right, and said he was going to seriously consider it.  I had to laugh when he said he went to work and fell asleep reading or trying to throw away some paperwork.  That was hilarious.  Can you imagine the secretary going in and finding "little bitty" daddy sitting there asleep.  I cracked up.The concert was good, you know those young men "showed out".  However, the concert was supposed to start at 8 and did not start til 9 and had several acts before them and as a result, did not get out of the concert until 1:15 p.m.   I was a tired sister, but it was well worth it.

I had to hear that, because I too feel confident that if we can get some nourishment into his body that he will get alot better.  I'm so glad you stepped in and are taking matters into your own hands.  I also feel like Daddy feels real good that you are stepping in as well.  I spoke with Mom yesterday, daddy was sleep, so she really got a chance to tell me how everything really is.  She too is now saying that Daddy is in pretty bad shape.I asked Daddy about the retirement, and he said the same thing,  he is not ready yet. but the reality of it is, is that we still need to move now and not wait.  I just hope he understands.  I'm glad Daddy is not in alot of pain.  I think with him seeing the boys will really cheer him up.  It's so hard to face all of this uncertainty isn't it.  The good part, if there is any, is that Daddy is going to a better place with no more suffering.  He's certainly had a good life and we all want him to go on forever, but if there is pain involved, I 'd rather see him out of pain.  Just keep praying for Daddy as well as Mom.
