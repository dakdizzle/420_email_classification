Since the terroristattacks on September 11, we have experienced a surge  in patriotism by themajority of Americans. However, the dust from the attacks had barelysettled in New York and Washington D.C. when the  "politically correct"crowd began complaining about the possibility that  our patriotism wasoffending others.I am not against immigration, nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who isseeking a  better life by coming to America. In fact, our country'spopulation is  almost entirely comprised of descendants of immigrants;however, there  are a few things that those who have recently come to ourcountry, and  apparently some native Americans, need to understand.First of  all, it is not our responsibility to continually try not tooffend you  in any way. This idea of America being a multi-culturalcommunity has  served only to dilute our sovereignty and our nationalidentity. As  Americans, we have our own culture, our own society, our ownlanguage,  and our own lifestyle. This culture, called the "American Way"has been  developed over centuries of struggles, trials, and victories bymillions  of men and women who have sought freedom. Our forefathers fought,bled,  and died at places such as Bunker Hill, Antietam, San Juan, IwoJima,  Normandy, Korea, Vietnam.We speak English, not Spanish, Arabic,  Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or anyother language. Therefore, if you  wish to become part of our society --learn our language!"In  God We Trust" is our national motto. This is not some off-the-wall,Christian, Right Wing, political slogan -- it is our national motto. It isengraved in stone in the House of Representatives in our Capitol and it isprinted on our currency. We adopted this motto because Christian  men andwomen, on Christian principles, founded this nation; and this is  clearlydocumented throughout our history. If it is appropriate  for our motto tobe inscribed in the halls of our highest level of  Government, then it iscertainly appropriate to display it on the walls  of our schools.God is in our pledge, our National Anthem,  nearly every patriotic song,and in our founding documents. We honor His  birth, death, and resurrectionas holidays, and we turn to Him in prayer  in times of crisis. If Godoffends you, then I suggest you consider  another part of the world as yournew home, because God is part of our  culture and we are proud to have Him.We are proud of our heritage and those who have so honorably defended ourfreedoms. We celebrate Independence Day, Memorial Day, Veterans Day, andFlag Day. We  have parades, picnics, and barbecues where we proudly waveour flag.  As an American, I have the right to wave my flag, sing mynational  anthem, quote my national motto, and cite my pledge whenever andwherever Ichoose. If the Stars and Stripes offend you, or you don't  like Uncle Sam,then you should seriously consider a move to another  part of this planet.The American culture is our way of life,  our heritage, and we are proud ofit. We are happy with our culture and  have no desire to change, and wereally don't care how you did things  where you came from. We areAmericans, like it or not, this is our  country, our land, and our lifestyle.Our First Amendment gives every citizen the right to express his opinionabout our government, culture, or society, and we will allow you everyopportunity to do so. But once you are done complaining, whining, andgriping about our flag, our pledge, our national motto, or our way of life,I highly  encourage you take advantage of one other great American freedom,the  right to leave.Barry LoudermilkIf you agree, pass this  onto other Americans!!It is time to take a  stand!!

In addition to purchasing from MHEB, we= need to focus heavily on selling to MHEB.  With the change of season, MHEB= may frequently be short.  As with purchases, EPMI will split any net savin=gs with MHEB and adjust their Reference Price accordingly- see 'M:Eservices=/MIDWEST SERVICE DEALS/Manitoba/Manitoba Hydro Services Deal Procedures.doc=. I realize that  market conditions have not been favorable for doing much =business with MHEB, but we need to give this deal more attention.  We are w=orking on other business opportunities with MHEB, and how we handle this de=al will affect future relationships with them.    In an effort to generate =information with which to formulate strategies to better service MHEB, plea=se maintain the price log located at: M:Eservices/MIDWEST SERVICE DEALS/Man=itoba/MHEB Price Log/MHEB November'01.doc. In addition to prices, both hour=ly and next day, record any relevant market information (see the log for ex=amples).

So, he went bear hunting. Hespotted a small brown bear and shotit. There was then a tap on his shoulder, and he turned around to see abig black bear. The black bearsaid: "You've got two choices. I either maul you to death or we haverough sex."Frank decided to bend over. Even though he felt sore for two weeks,Frank soon recovered andvowed revenge. He headed out on another trip where he found the blackbear and shot it.There was another tap on his shoulder. This time a huge grizzly bearstood right next to him.The grizzly said: "That was a huge mistake, Frank. You've got twochoices. Either I maulyou to death or we have REALLY rough sex."Again, Frank thought it wasbetter tocomply. Although he survived, it would take several months beforeFrankfinally recovered.Outraged he headed back to the woods, managed totrack down the grizzlyand shot it.He felt sweet revenge, but then there was a tap on his shoulder.

I bought a house in League City.  In addition, I asked Shannon to marry me but that fell through during the summer.  We are trying to see if we can salvage any of the relationship.

Travis is back from his year and a half tour in Europe, and took a position with Cemex as an account manager.  Dad is about 3/4 retired and he and mom are doing a fair amount of hunting & fishing.
