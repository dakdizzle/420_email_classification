I received an offer to trade for UBS which I have accepted. Our desk will be very small to start out.  Brad did not accept his offer and is moving to Kansas City to work for Aquila.  Pete quit before he was made an offer to work for a bank in New York City.  I am so happy for him.  All that is left are me, Scott, Judy (working full-time), Chuck, Sandra and Jon McKay.  Scott wants to trade all the points we were trading before so it should be interesting.  He is going to trade the Hub physical and financial.  Judy and I are going to split up everything else. Chuck is going to trade market area.  Frank Vickers, Jared and Craig are all that is left of origination.  Jared had a baby girl on Thursday.  Her name is Kendall Gill (do not know where the Gill came from)  and everyone is doing fine.How are you doing?  Andy

Originally I thought this would be a terrible t=hing to not have a job at Enron or in the energy sector but as time goes on= I have come to think maybe it would just force us to do something else wit=h our lives.  Something we have thought about for a long time. It is a trag=edy that after 25 years of service we will get no severance.  I feel so sad= for all those people who lost everything including a job.

Tuesday is fine for dinner - looking forward to it.  It looks like UBS Warburg is our new owner.  We do not have any information yet from our management so I can't tell you any more about the structure of the company.  Hopefully I'll know more by Tuesday.  Let me know what time on Tuesday. Maybe we could eat somewhere closer to the loop since we only work until around 3:00 right now and you are out that way and Cindy has to go that way.

Jeff asked that I provide to you the pipeline contracts we will need to put into place for the East Trading desk as soon as possible after  we find out who is going to buy us.  As expected the pipelines would only provide us will shell sgreements but we would like to get a step ahead by having legal review them so we can hopefully turn them around quickly when credit is established with the new entity.  You should receive them this afternoon.  I am at X35775.                                                                                                                    Thank you!

gerald.nemec@enron.com,gerald.nemec@enron.com,gerald.nemec@enron.com,Subject: Napoleonville Storage,Per our verbal discussion of Friday January 4, I requested 2000MMBtu/d of storage gas for the period January 5-7 to serve an existing market on Florida Pipeline. Ragan Bond at Bridgeline informed me that my request would be denied.  ENA needed to purchase pre-paid gas from Sequent to fulfill the market's request for additional supplies.  ENA did not attempt to schedule the delivery of gas out of storage after Bridgeline informed me they would not perform on our request because we would have needed to request the customer to submitt a nomination for a delivery that would not be confirmed.  Please let me know if you need additional information concerning this transaction.
robary@cs.com,robary@cs.com,robary@cs.com,Subject: RE: Note,Hi Aunt Mary and Uncle Bob,              Sorry it has taken me so long to write.  Life is not good here at Enron.  I have been asked to stay on until the company I work for is sold.  I have been told I will be a part of the new company in it's proposed format.  Many things can change between now and then and I am very skeptical as the company has told so many lies to so many people.  It was so sad the day they let all those people go.  I felt sad and guilty because I still had a job.  Dick's company has basically been shut down.  He was asked to stay on as a key person to help close down the business.  His job will eventually end but we have no time frame.  I know you are probably wondering about our financial situation.  We had sold all our Enron stock in our 401K some time ago so we have done ok.             It is so wonderful that you will get to see everyone sometime during the holidays.  Please tell them hello and MERRY CHRISTMAS.  It sounds like everyone is doing well.  Michele is disappointed we are not coming home for Christmas but Dick is on call and he wants to work as long as possible.  He keeps saying he is going to retire but I think he will get bored and end up going back to work especially if I am still working.  I wish I could say more but for so long now our lives have been consumed with being part of the biggest bankrupcy in history and it has become very depressing.  Take care.All our love.P.S.  Next time I write I promise to be more upbeat.
