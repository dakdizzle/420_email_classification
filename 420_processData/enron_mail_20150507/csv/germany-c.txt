I can't remember exactly what she said but I sure do wish you wouldn't tell her anymore STUFF about us.  I finally figured out that her and Jim are very similar.  Information is power that they can share with others, even useless trivia information about friends.  I don't think either one of them mean any harm, they just can't keep their big mouths shut.I'm off to another wild day of tariff review.

This gas was parked at Bear Creek on a Tenn park and loan contract.  It is scheduled to come out on Sonat.  To my knowledge, we don't have any Sonat demand charges.  But our monthly demand charge expense on Tenn is at least $376,000.00, mainly due to the Boston Gas netback deal.  I think Tenn would make us prepay the Tenn demand charges to get this gas out of the park & loan on Sonat.We have 500,000 that was scheduled to come out in December on Sonat.  I have no idea how Tenn/Sonat will bill us for this contract going forward.

Our monthly demand charge expense is $290,000.00.  I would also assume that we would have to prepay the EES demand charges as well.

It was under the dresser in his bed room.I placed it in the linen closet third shelf from the top, back left.  It iscaptured in a pistol storage case.  I stuck it in behind the sheets andthings.  I saw Chad and Angela on my way out.  They are a great couple.Jerry, I am going to be very busy with the scrap here at work.  I am goingto get in touch with Gerald and you and him can work out the agreement if hewants to lease Dad's pasture.As I stated he will pay $20/acre per year.  You had said we do not want topay for a fence along the creek.  When I have leased places in the past Ihave had to build new fence at my own expense.  Most folk's base theircow/calf operations on a five year program/depreciation.  If I built fenceand that particular piece of property sold before the five years was up,then I was reinversed the balance of my initial fence/material investment,excluding my labor.  Something to think about.  I hope we do not own thatplace for five more years.  Gerald also said he would mow the grass aroundthe house and sort of keep the place tuned up.Ma fell Saturday Night and busted her forehead.  They placed her inAngleton/Danbury for overnight observation.  I think she required aboutseven stitches in her head.  There were x-rays taken and her lungs arepretty much gone.  Of course, that depends on how well the x-ray tech canread his prints.Stopped by and saw Bernie Max.  Now where did they come up with a name likethat?  They removed the lymph glands from his neck.  Starting down the torsojust at the left collar bone, a width of about three inches go down thetorso about six or seven inches.  A triangle shape about the size of a pieceof large pizza.  The incision must have been about 1.5/1.75 inches deep intohis body.  The doctor told him it was only fatty tissue.  They took a prettybig chunk out of his chest.  He had a six " x eight " piece of skin removedfrom his left thing for a skin graft.  It looked pretty painful.  He was ingood spirits and bull corning around.I guess that is about it.  I would like to have a timber appraisal performedon the Dad's place.  I'll be chatting with you guys.  Oh, I forgot the dangremote to the TV.  I really was not for sure which one it was.

Every night I take these here fish down to the lake and letthemswim around for a while. I whistle and they jump back into theirbuckets,and I take em home.""That's a bunch of hooey! Fish can't do that!"The man looked at the game warden for a moment, and then said, "Here,I'llshow you. It really works.""O.K. I've GOT to see this!." The game warden was curious, now.The man poured the fish in to the lake and stood and waited.After several minutes, the game warden turned to the man and said,"Well?""Well, What?" the man responded."When are you going to call them back?" The game warden prompted."Call who back?" The man asked."The fish." replied the warden."What fish?" The man asked.

I'll just give you the highlights.Duke Energy acquired Market Hub Partners Storage (MHP) from subsidiaries of NiSource, INC.  MHP currently operates 2 facilities.  The Moss Bluff facility in Liberty County, Texas, and the Egan facility in Acadia Parish, La.I have never used Moss Bluff, I know it interconnects with Tetco in Stx.  I like Egan - it hooks up with ANR, Tex Gas, Tenn, CGLF, and Trunkline.

The Junecontract climbed$0.04 to $4.279 per MMBtu. June rose $0.039 to $4.353 per MMBtu. The marketwas basically just marking time until the AGA releases the latest storageinjection figures this afternoon. The AGA is expected to announce anaddition to storage of about 100 Bcf. A somewhat lower injection could sparka rally because the market has already discounted a triple digit build.However, an injection of over 115 Bcf could send the market to $4.00 in ahurry. A year ago, stocks for the same week rose 58 Bcf, and the five-yearaverage injection is 61 Bcf. Since the AGA began reporting storage data, thehighest ever recorded was 78 Bcf in 1998. If current weather models hold up,the Midwest and Texas will escape much of the summer's hottest temperatures,and right now, temperatures are mild across most of the nation. Look fortechnical support at the $4.20 level, and resistance is expected at $4.40.Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada generally slipped$0.10  $0.15 per MMBtu yesterday, except in the west where most spot pricesrose due to hot weather. Natural for next day delivery at the Henry hubdropped $0.12 to $4.21 per MMBtu.________________________________________________25TH Annual CIS ConferenceMay 15-18, 2001Albuquerque, NMThe CIS Conference provides utility management personnel unequaled insightand current information on customer relationship management (CRM),e-commerce, technologies and marketing.

Lay spoke after receiving the US EnergyAssociation's 2001 US Energy Award, saying that today we don't have openaccess to the transmission grid, and we could get more power into the Westif we had open access. He says the FERC should open up the power gridthroughout the nation so generators no longer have to pay a series ofseparate fees to move electricity from one region to another. He also saysFERC has the authority to open up the power grid in the same way thatnatural gas pipeline transmissions work. It's clear we've under-invested inenergy infrastructure in the last 10 to 15 years, and it's going to take afew years to correct that.________________________________________________And now there's FASB 133.

A binding open season is being held on PhaseOne of Sonoran - which would run from the San Juan Basin in New Mexico tothe California border - to give shippers the opportunity to commit to firmcapacity on the pipeline.  A non-binding open season is being heldsimultaneously on Phase Two of the project - which would extend the pipelinefrom the California border to the San Francisco Bay area - to give potentialshippers the opportunity to express their interest in obtaining firmcapacity to California delivery points.  Sonoran has received a bindingcommitment from Calpine Energy Services for 400,000 Dth per day on Phase Oneand a non-binding commitment for 500,000 Dth per day for Phase Two. Theproposed pipeline will be a 1,030-mile, high-pressure interstate natural gaspipeline from the San Juan Basin in northern New Mexico to markets inCalifornia and is projected to be in-service date by the summer of 2003._______________________________________________Progas Storage Services, Incwas recently organized to offer specialized natural gas storage services tomarketers and end users servicing the upper Midwest and Northeast marketregions along the major transmission systems in Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky,and Michigan.

Last week the governor said he wouldseek to force the suppliers to accept reduced payment for billions ofdollars owed by the states utilities. In the face of a state investigationinto alleged market manipulation, some generators are willing to discusslimits on prices for some electricity sold to the state. Williams says it isprepared to support temporary price controls that would extend through thesummer of 2002. Williams is also willing to discuss a range of possiblealternatives for repayment of past debts owed to it. Reliant will reiteratean earlier offer to sell some electricity to the state at $20 per MWh if thebuyer will pay for the natural gas to generate the power. Duke Energy hasproposed accepting less than full payment for power sold to the state inreturn for an end to state and federal investigations into the prices theycharged. Duke, Enron, AES, Dynegy, Mirant, El Paso Energy, Reliant, andWilliams will all send executives to Sacramento to the meeting.______________________________________________GasTrader.NetBULLS CAUTIOUSIn spite of slip sliding natural gas prices, analysts are still cautiouslybullish. There seems to be little incentive to abandon the bullish causewith the prospects of hot summer weather looming."This is a weak market, butI think that below $4.60 you have to anticipate the return of industrialdemand. It's really a wild card as to whether that demand will take the edgeoff the current large injections. Over the past month, the market has gonethrough a major change. Production has increased, storage  is higher, andthe injection last week at 102 BCF was the largest since June of 1998,' saysGeorge Ellis, broker analyst with BNP Paribas, New York. "I was skeptical of the whole concept of demand erosion, but it's obviously real and when youcombine that with an increase in production, the supply demand balancebecomes clear. There is potentially more room to the downside, but the wildcard is weather and if that kicks in, prices could move sharply higher. Ifprices fell to $4.38 then that would be a reason to put on another 25%hedge. As long as we're holding these prices I think there's a good chanceprices will rally higher. I'm cautiously bullish. I would not be anaggressive seller," he said.For a Complimentary 5 week GasTrader Subscription go tohttp://www.gastrader.net or call 303/761-7470_____________________________________________________TRENTON/BLACKRIVER "BOOM" IN WEST VIRGINIALand and Mineral Development LLC., Vienna, West Virginia, owns 85,000 acresof mineral rights in Southeastern West Virginia.

TheCalifornia ordered that as of 3:10 PM the state's utilities must cut 400 MW.Blackouts had been forecast by the ISO since early in the morning with theheat coming at a time when many power plants are still off-line formaintenance. The Los Angeles Department and Power, was as usual was excludedfrom the blackouts. The LADWP is not under the ISO's control and has morethan enough generation to meet its demand. The ISO said demand was runningabout 1,000 MW above Monday's levels. Earlier Tuesday, the ISO had projectedblackouts could be ordered before noon, but the return to service of two500-kilovolt lines operated by BC Hydro meant more power was able to flowsouth. About 700 MW produced by small suppliers, known as QualifyingFacilities, are currently offline because they have not been paid. The hottemperatures are likely to continue today, with the threat of moreblackouts._______________________________________________CAMINUSENERGY SOFTWARESHOWCASE 2001HOUSTON, TEXASYou're InvitedTo a four hour exposition of software and services that will set the newstandard for the energy trading, scheduling, and risk management.

Left Wed afternoon and got back Friday afternoon.  One of the pipelines I deal with has a hunting and fishing lodge down there.  It was nice.  I caught 2 redfish - both keepers too!  The guide would bait my hook and throw it in the water.  All I had to do was sit there and look pretty till the fish started biting.  I could really get used to that sort of thing.The fishing guide said I should expect to pay about $1,000/ft for my fishing boat.  I guess my boat will only be about 4 ft long.   Keep looking for my BOAT.Let's see - the ex wife came in from Denver for a wedding Friday night.  She stayed with me all weekend.  I took her to the airport this morining.  Things went pretty well - no romance, just good friends.  I introduced her to my girlfriend - we all had lunch together.  That was a little odd.Nothing else going on.  I'll try to have an update on the legal stuff by Wed.Later Gator.

Donna!!!   Welcome to the party!Wade, I don't know how to handle these deals in Sitara or Tagg but I bet someone on this distribution does.  1.  Does anyone have any idea on how to stop deals 340305 and 332163 from creating an invoice each month?2.  There are deal volumes in Sitara for the East, Central and West desk.  Should these volumes be zeroed out or should we just focus on keeping tagg updated and not worry about Sitara?  Maybe someone is working on the Sitara deal volumes.

Both of the Midland deals still show up in the trading system.  Should they be terminated effective 6/1/2002?  One of the Midland deals (MCV 2, deals #340305 and 332163) was put in Sitara with triggers.  We stopped serving MCV 2 effective 4/1/2002.  These triggers will continue to create an invoice each month unless we change the deal in Sitara.

One of the students raised her hand andasked,"What gender is acomputer?"The teacher wasn't certain and divided the classinto twogroups:  malesin one, females in the other, and asked them todecide ifa computer shouldbe masculine or feminine. Both groups were askedto givefour reasons fortheir recommendations.    The group of women concluded that computersshould bereferred to asmasculine because:1. In order to get their attention, you have toturn themon.2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless.3. They are supposed to help you solve yourproblems, buthalf the time,they ARE the problem.4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that,if youhad waited alittle longer, you could have had a better model.    The men, on the other hand, decided thatcomputersshould definitely bereferred to as feminine because:1. No one but their creator understands theirinternallogic.2. The native language they use to communicatewith othercomputers isincomprehensible to everyone else.3.  Even your smallest mistakes are stored inlong-termmemory for laterretrieval.4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, youfindyourself spending halfyour paycheck on accessories for it.

The sides were approximately6/8" tall with a center console and a very large ice chest mounted directlybehind that which served as a seat.  It also had what I call a jack plate onthe motor for vertical lift prop clearance between boat and bay bottom.  Hecould run in about 8" of h2o.  If I remember correctly it was a V 6 150horse Yamaha.

Texas Gas is cheaper than Trco even after paying the transport cost.  However, this deal comes to the TP2 book at the prices listed below.

The backyard sits next to some big building - that's a bad thing.  I have not had a chance to look at the other house - the sq footage seems really small though.  Based on what I've seen over the last 8 months, it would take something around $190's - $205's to make me happy and I'm not willing to spend that much right now.Another thing that bothers me is the economy.

The only time capacity would be recalled is on peak days.  Also, according to my Transco schedulers, PSE&G does not accept contract number changes after 12:30 PM the day before gas flows.  If we were using released capacity to serve a market at PSE&G and the capacity was recalled intra-day, we would not be able to schedule the gas because of PSE&G's nomination and scheduling procedures.  This is an interesting point because the only term capacity release deal we have on the East Desk is with PSE&G.However, we do support intra-day capacity release.

Brenda Fletcher was asking me Enron has the following deals with AEC at Niagara and Leidy.Deal #		Vol	Buy/Sale	Location	End Term	Book592845		9189	Buy		Tenn Niagara	10/31/2008	New England223854		9189	Sale		Tenn Niagara	10/31/2008	New England415547		9000	Buy		Nful Niagara	10/31/2002	East TP1415547		6000	Buy		Nful Leidy	10/31/2002	East TP11131708	6000	Sale		Nful Leidy	10/31/2008	East TP1When this deal was done 2 years ago, AEC agreed to give Enron the NFUL transport (I don't know who at Enron agreed to this).  Enron pays NFUL max demand for the space.  I believe the contract price on deal 415547 is a NFUL Leidy price, and part of it should be adjusted for demand, commodity, and fuel.  Also the net delivered volume at Leidy is 9005 dth ( = 9189 at Niagara).Kam, I'm not sure which firm book this is in.  Over the last few months, I would calculate the transfer price from the firm book to TP1 (or TP3).  As TP1, I take any NFUL length at a CNG equivalent price.  I also created deal 1147662 at 0 price to balance out Niagara.Also, I believe we need to bill AEC for the demand charges for the last 2 years of this deal.  That's around $1,340,000.  I'm sure AEC is not expecting that.  Does anyone here talk to AEC?

ingrid.immer@williams.com,ingrid.immer@williams.com,ingrid.immer@williams.com,Subject:  A Donkey Story,One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally he decided the animal was old and the well needed to be covered up anyway. It just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey.He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement, he quieted down. A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well and was astonished at what he saw.With every shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up.  As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and trotted off!Now, the Moral of the Story:Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up.  Each of our troubles is a stepping stone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up!Remember the five simple rules to be happy:1. Free your heart from hatred.2. Free your mind from worries.3. Live simply.4. Give more.5. Expect less.P.S.: The donkey later came back and kicked THE SHIT out of the bastard that tried burying him.Moral: When you try to cover your ass, it always comes back to get you.

He said that Sempra just called him and wanted to know why WE locked the points on the contract in our posting.  I told him we locked them because we didn't want to get billed a potentially higher rate.1)  This guy acted like he knew me and of course I was embarrassed so I acted like I knew him, AND I DON'T EVER REMEMBER TALKING TO THIS GUY.  He knew that I had gone to EES and that was back in 1997-1998.2)  Sempra told Kevin that we would get more value if we let someone change the points.  I wonder, even though we might get billed max rate, would it be possible to allow the replacement shipper to change the points for "the term of the release only AND the releasing shipper would be billed more that max rate" and that way the capacity would go back to its original contract points in October.Just a thought.

She handles the accounting for these deals and she said they have to do everything outside the system because ENA is not collecting the slaes revenue or making the payments to the suppliers.  Joe was very concerned about putting deals in Sitara because he was afraid that we might double bill TXU.  There is also a problem with the Feb activity because TXU recorded all the activity as ENA activity instead of Ponderosa Pine activity.  It also appears that TXU withholds payments for the smallest indiscretions in the billing too.  We can chat about that next week.Sabra, do you know what points Apache/Cinergy and Williams is giving us the gas at?  I'd like to see that if possible.ThanksI'm taking off Friday.

Lyn at TXU asked me if the gas was at the same point for tomorrow and I told her "sure" and I have no idea what points our gas is coming from.I don't know how much time we need to spend on this.  But, I have not put anything in Sitara and I don't know if I should.  I believe Theresa Voss's (on 3 in Enron Center South) group is handling the accounting for this and I don't know what they need.

This supply is matched up with ENA's sale to The City of Tallahassee.  I believe both deals go through March 2013.  I prepay Dominion for the supply each month.This morning, I had a voicemail from my contact at Dominion, David Walker (405-749-5240).  His voicemail stated that Dominion was terminating their contract with ENA and Dominion would not be supplying any gas effective April 1, 2002.  Paul Vrana (713-752-4514) with Jackson Walker is representing Dominion, he prepared the termination letter.  Just spoke with Paul (10:55 AM) - he has not spoken with anyone representing Enron but he has worked with Harlam Murphy?? in the past.  He will fax a letter to me.Kay, I will leave a copy of the letter in your chair.

Note: this would only happen with Brigdeline because it is and Enron affiliate and because we are using the same trading systems.Approving this ticket will give Bridgeline the ability to bill ENA.  I think there might be another way to do this without someone at ENA approving a ticket.  I'll see what I can do.

ingrid.immer@williams.com,ingrid.immer@williams.com,ingrid.immer@williams.com,Subject: FW: profile,i took the test and this is what it said.colors green blue yello purple red black white orangeYou are a very sensitive person and you try hard (perhaps a little too hard) to make favourable impressions and to be recognised by your peers. But you have that inherent need to feel appreciated and admired and you are easily hurt if all of your endeavours go by unappreciated or not acknowledged. Stop trying so hard.You are very talented, imaginative and sensitive but you are holding back as you do not really like going it 'on your own'. In preference you would like to team up with someone, someone with similar attributes as your own, to explore - to seek out and go perhaps 'where no other man has trod before'. It is the unusual that attracts you and which will give you a sense of excitement and adventure.Everything seems to have gone wrong and the situation at this time is such that you are not quite sure which way to turn. So it would appear that you are 'holding back', re-consolidating your position and relinquishing all fun and games for the time being.You are holding back. You need to find friends in whom you can trust and once they have proved themselves beyond all possible doubt you will be prepared to give them your all. The existing situation is not of your liking - you have an unsatisfied need for mental stimulation with others whose standards are as high as your own. Trying to control your instincts the way you do restricts your ability to open up to others and the way you feel at this time is suggestive of 'total surrender'. This is not to your liking as you consider such thoughts as weaknesses that need to be overcome. You feel that only by control, controlling your innermost thoughts, are you able to maintain your air of superiority. You want to be admired for yourself alone and not for what you can do or for what you may have done. In essence 'you need to be needed' and at the same time 'you need to need'.You need to be respected as an exceptional individual. This is the only way that you can hope to achieve the status that you wish to achieve. You set yourself very high standards - and come what may - you abide by them.Don't date or hook yourself up with a hussy.  Just remember, no woman deserves you and they should all thank their lucky stars that you even ackknowledge them.

"We must know that you will follow your instructions, no matter what the circumstances. Inside of this room, you will find your wife sitting in a chair. Kill her!!!" The man said, "You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife." The agent said, "Then you are not the right man for this job."The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about 5 minutes. Then the man came out with tears in his eyes. "I tried, but I can't kill my wife." The agent said, "You don't have what it takes. Take your wife and go home."Finally, it was the woman's turn. She was given the same instructions, to kill her husband. She took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one shot after another. They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the woman. She wiped the sweat from her brow and said, "This gun was loaded with blanks. I had to beat him to death with the chair."Moral: Women are evil.

Later today we will take the first step to reduce the headcount of the organization.  For many of our fellow workers today will be the last day at Aquila.  For those not released today, we will need to, as carefully and responsibly as possible, put our beloved company to bed.

Dominion gave me the ENA balances over the phone.  When I called back a day later to get the EES balances, I was told to submit a written request to Bill Saviers, Dominion's in house counsel.  I have not done that.  I would prefer that Dominion provide us a written document stating what the pool balances are as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01.  Based on the pool balances below, I would recommend terminating the ENA pools effective 12/3/01 assuming the following.	1.  Producer payments for Oct and Nov have not been made and go into the pre-petition bucket.	2.  ENA owes Dominion gas which is also pre-petition.	3.  The producers will be able to reallocate their gas for December forward to another marketer's pool.Items to considerIf we terminate the pools on 12/31/01 or later, ENA will need to sell the imbalance gas and pay the producers.  Dominion will need to provide ENA a method to do this if the pools are terminated.  I would recommend paying the producers after we collect the money for selling the imbalance gas AND after we pay Dominion any gathering/transporting charges associated with those balances.  The volumes are small so ENA will not see much economic benefit from this process.  Also, the administrative effort involved is VERY VERY HIGH due to the small volumes per producer.Dominion will prefer to cancel the pools with a 0 or positive imbalance.  On 12/3/01, ENA will still have a negative cumulative imbalance.Most of the producers have not been paid for Oct or Nov 2001 activity.  I assume that since those dollars go into a pre-petition bucket that we should not terminate any producer contracts before 12/3/01.	3/5/02 Per Vickie Coen at DominionENA Pool Balances as of			11/30/01	12/31/01	Gath North		1,323		2,187		Tran North		0		0Gath South		(26,482)		31,583Tran South		5,412		8,143Cumulative		(19,747)		41,913Dominion IF PricesMar 2002	$2.59Feb 2002	$2.20Jan 2002	$2.79Dec 2001	$2.42Nov 2001	$3.37Oct 2001	$2.02Sep 2001	$2.42

Jim will also let us take different volumes on different days over the weekend, even though it hasn't happened before.Have a good weekend!

This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it.  I need to know;1.  What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas.  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.Other items;ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.2/20/02Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.2/25/02Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.1:10 PM.  Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.3/11/02Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal.  Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.3/13/02Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled.  Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID.  Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.3:30 PM  Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it.  She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination.  I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.3:40 PM  Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.

Peoples Gas invoices ENA about $400.00 a month for a License Fee, Customer Service Charge, and taxes and it looks like we have not paid this bill for the last 3 months.  In the pre-petition world, we used this ID to do nominations on the Peoples Gas system.  We are not currently using this ID and it looks like we no longer need an ID for this system.  BUT, Kevin Brady, an ENA scheduler, uses an Enovate and EMW LLC id to do nominations for those companies. Enovate is paying the invoices for those companies.  Can we cancel this ID, or should we just tell Peoples we are not going to pay the invoice and let them terminate the ID at their discretion?  Will not paying the ENA invoice impact EMW LLC or Enovate in any way?

He is a Resource Management Analyst at Boston Gas working for Liz Danehy.  According to Joe, ENA is still billing Boston Gas for part of the demand charges on the long term producer netback deal (that Ruth is so familiar with).  This is Iroquois and Tennessee capacity I am releasing back to Boston Gas each month at a 100% demand rate.Joe asked me why we were doing this and I told him that ENA was probably not paying the capacity bills and Boston Gas was aware of that fact and knew Boston Gas would be liable for the demand charges anyway.  Sounds like Boston Gas may be getting double billed and Joe said they will probably not pay the invoice.

TDC stated that it would "file a claim for administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all other necessary relief against ENA" if ENA did not remit payment by the close of business Feb 22, 2002.  Based on the information in this email it appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00.  Kay, Ed, Question:  I have not contacted TDC to determine if they have filed a claim with the court.  Would that have any impact on making a payment to TDC?  Should I contact TDC?Calculation of Post-Petition Payment using Dec 3 as Post-Petition dayGas scheduled Dec 3-24, 26-31 = 28 days, volume = 3,000 dth per day28 x 3,000 x $2.419 = $203,196.00

From ENA's perspective, I would prefer to terminate the pools effective 11/30/01.  That would leave ENA with a negative pre-petition imbalance on Dominion and ENA would not have to pay the producers for December production or worry about selling a positive imbalance in an un-friendly market.  However, Dominion will probably not let ENA terminate the pools until 12/31/2001 due to the negative cumulative imbalance.Questions that need to be answered, 	** will ENA have to pay the producers for December (possibly January) production if Dominion will not let ENA terminate the pools any earlier?	** how will Dominion handle the positive imbalance if the pool is terminated on 12/31/01 or later?	The operations contact at Dominion is Iris King (304-627-3213), she is one of the managers over the operations group.

This balancing agreement should have been cashed out every month.  She wouldn't tell me the current balance.  ENA had a term sale to EES (sitara #1003036).  The volume was 1,200 dth per day in Tenn Zone 5 and the name of the point was Bethlehem Sales.  The term of the sale matches the term of the capacity release from Boston Gas.Firm Gas Storage Service K# 38454 (FS-MA Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & Gas CompanyGas Transportation Agreement K# 38535 (FT-A Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & Gas CompanyGas Transportation Agreement K# 38539 (FT-A Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & GAs Company   All 3 capacity releases from NYSEG are non-recallable.  In my opinion, this capacity should be the property of the customers EES was serving behind the NYSEG city gate and the capacity should go with the customers.  But, I believe we need to address the LDC tariff issues along with the pipeline issues.Gas Transportation Agreement K#27848 (IT)   Supply Aggregation Servic e Agreement K# 80265 (SA)Of all the items shown above, I am more concerned with the Balancing Agreement k#31905.  We need to know what has happened to the sales customers EES had at this point.  I believe it was just one customer.  How is this customer currently getting its gas?  If Enron is still the operator of the balancing agreement at this point, does it "appear" that Enron is still using this agreement?

robin.barbe@enron.com,robin.barbe@enron.com,robin.barbe@enron.com,Subject: Steve Coopers voicemail transcript,Hi everybody. It's Steve Cooper. It's Friday afternoon, March 1. I hope everybody has had a great week. I want to update everybody on a number of things that have gone on this week, so that you all will be fully in the loop. The week started in a rough-and-tumble fashion. I went to a town meeting Monday night to meet with a number of our ex-colleagues. Their disappointment, upset and anger is very understandable. I, along with the entire management team, have committed that we are going to try to do whatever we can to fashion a reasonable resolution to their various issues. In order to make sure that those that are truly in need have something to fall back on, we asked the court later in the week and got the judge to approve an emergency $5 million fund. We are now going to fish around for an independent administrator to evaluate the needs and disperse those dollars to former employees. I wanted you to be aware of that. I really do appreciate and understand everybody's upset. Last Friday, February 22, we presented to the Creditors' Committee a formal proposal on a retention and severance program. As can be expected, there was some push back from the committee -- there were issues about some of the data, there were requests for additional data and further clarification. The Creditors' Committee formed a subcommittee. We provided to them more data. Jeff McMahon and I met with them on Wednesday, February 27, and we met with them again on Thursday, February 28. We are scheduled to meet with them again on Monday and Tuesday to resolve all the open issues and to get the full support and endorsement of the Creditors' Committee on this program. I have indicated to the subcommittee that getting a plan in place is Jeff's and my highest priority. It is not right or fair for anyone to be in a state of ongoing uncertainty about their future, their future compensation, and any financial safety net, so we are going to have to move on this at light speed. I told the creditors' subcommittee and asked that they tell the full committee that we want to be in a position by the week of March 11 to motion this up to the court. I'll keep you posted on progress. I am comfortable that the committee wants to put in place the retention and severance program and now we are just working out the bugs. Hopefully, by the time we have the employee meeting, we can walk through the composition of the program in detail. The powers that be - management in conjunction with the human resources group - are working on merit increases and promotions. Hopefully all the details of a program will be finalized next week. Then, the process is typically that business unit managers begin to calculate salary increases. And it works its way through the review, approval and communication process. So hopefully, we'll have that all resolved in the next week or two and everyone will know where they stand with respect to promotions and merit increases. We reached an accord with the Astros this week to repatriate to Enron $2.1 million for the release of our rights to the naming contract. It is a shame we won't be in a position to support the naming of the field, but it is probably in the best interest of the estate. I got a great suggestion from one of our colleagues about auctioning Enron Field signs and contributing net proceeds to the ex-employees' fund. I'd like your input on that. I thought it was a great idea and very generous. We are moving forward with plans for an employee meeting later this month. Hopefully I'll be able to meet many of you there. I've tried to get around to say hello here and there. And again, I would encourage you if you have any questions, concerns or issues just give me an email or a buzz. Sometimes it takes a few days for me to get back to you, but I'm making a very concerted effort to answer everybody's inquiries. Other than that I don't have a lot to report. We'll continue to hammer out with the committee the retention program. Hopefully by next Friday I'll be able to report very substantial progress in this area. I want to thank everybody for their efforts, all their hard work and their focus on moving things forward. One other thing... We did have a bank meeting on Thursday afternoon. We have described to the banks what we believe is a very reorganizable entity here. We'll be sharing more about that at the employee meeting. I told the bank group, and it was echoed by management, that we believe there is a reorganizable, viable entity in Enron's future. I'll bring you all fully up to speed on that at the employee meeting. Anyway, as I was saying... Thanks so much for all your hard work, your efforts, your dedication. I hope you have a great weekend. I'll chat with next week.

(an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 	1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to	2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.

maria.garza@enron.com,maria.garza@enron.com,maria.garza@enron.com,Subject: Sonat Park & Loans and Sale to Sonat,This is what I want to send to our "Team".  Would you please do a quick review just before I send it out?These are my notes on the Sonat Park & Loan.  I have not spoken with any legal counsel representing ENA.Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.ENA recognizes a balance of 197,537 dth - the difference is ENA is not netting the 96,000 dth Loan with the park and Sonat is showing and additional day of withdrawal of 8,588 dth in January 2002.Chris's notes:Sonat Park & Loans2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount went the gas was parked in August.Other items;ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.2/20/02Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

I'll finish it tomorrow but I wanted you to have it in case I get hit by a bus or something.  good niteSonat Park & Loans2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer at Sonat (205-326-2007)ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Dec 2001 or Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001 that ENA has not paid for.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].Other items;ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).

Tetco will be the problem pipeline.  I called my rep again and asked her to seriously look into it.  I'm thinking worse case is they will need either cash or a letter of credit for about $1,000,000.00.  I'm using the following formula	MDQ (22,000 dth) x 20 days x $ some cashout price They may cut back on the number of days but the cashout price is the problem.  It's a moving target and I expect prices to go up.  I think that if we just agreed to give them a letter of credit for $1 mill and then prepay for any actual expenses we incur, we could build our reputation on the pipeline, at least until we get rid of these deals.  If all the gas flows like it should, we should never have any actual expenses on any of these pipelines for the Keyspan deal.Who knows what volumes are going to be?

I'm requesting $22,500.00 to be prepaid to TXU - that's about 5 days of supply for the Tallahassee deal.The second prepay is for 1 day of interruptible transportation on Tennessee.  If we are unable to purchase gas from TXU or Reliant, we will use the Bear Creek storage gas on Tennessee to supply the Tallahassee deal.  This is what we did on the 2nd-6th.  I am also anticipating that the discounted IT rate on Tennessee will be higher for gas flow on the 7th.My goal is to maintain 2 active suppliers (with prepays) on the East Coast, TXU and Reliant.  I would also like to set up a trading contract with another supplier (maybe Coral) in case TXU or Reliant decides to stop doing business with ENA.  Our supplier for the swing gas on the Tallahassee deal in January was Sequent.  However, last Thursday, Sequent stopped doing business with ENA because it was too much of a burden for them to keep track of the ENA prepays and the daily volumes.  So far we have spent 3 business days trying to secure another supplier.  We will also be able to use TXU and Reliant as suppliers for any other deals that we are able to start up.

Sequent says this deal is an administrative burden and has elected not to supply any more gas to ENA after 2/1/2002.  Scott Goodell called Aaron Bohall with PanCanadian to see if they would become our new swing supplier.  Aaron told me that they would sell us gas under the following conditions, 	the deal has to be on PanCanadian's paper	we need to let PanCanadian know by 8:00 AM every morning	and ENA must take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays.This is a problem because Tallahassee does not have to take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays and Tallahassee does not need to notify ENA until 9:00 AM.  Aaron will see if they can work with a 9:00 AM deadline.
