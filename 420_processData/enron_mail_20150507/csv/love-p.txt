I made this extremely simple on our first pass, but I left in the tabs that were in the old/current file.  All you would do would be to go to the fin tab and hard code balance of month price for each of the curve locations(yellow column).  This will then set the gas daily curve.  We will continue to true up to gas daily each day.  You may want to also reset the next day's curve as well, since this is a hardcode, you simply type over the previous day's load.  The phys tab pulls from the fin tab and adds the phys prem to it.  We can increase the complexity of this file by adding formulas or tabs if you like.

It is probably a good idea for future term=ination scripts to come through Greg before going to IT because of several =book moves we have made to facilitate reporting to Ed McMichael.

I am attaching a map from El Cajon to Houston for driving directions.  They say it will take 24+hours, I calculated the time and I think the jilly mobile can do it in 20.  Ashley is probably going to drive the Burban over to NO and I am going to fly because of work.  So you guys only have to drive to Houston and she will do the rest.  Sounds like a good idea to me(yeah right).  I will even throw in a Love trip back to SD this summer/fall if I can get a visit in April.

I cancelled my service with you over a month ago and asked that you keep from sending me a bill.  My service was cancelled immediately and I was told I would receive a bill from you and I would then have to call and dispute the bill to have my account credited.  I asked at that time since I had waited on hold that time for 30 minutes that this matter be taken care of immediately so that I would not have to call back and sit on hold again for half an hour.  Your customer service manager, very rudely I might add,  said that was impossible and I would just have to do it anyway.  Since I have had to wait on hold today for so long I want this email to serve as my dispute and have my account closed and the balance due removed since you terminated my service and I did not get the use of my phone.  Just a word of advice, I would hire more customer service representatives if you plan on keeping customer to serve.  This is by far the worst customer service experience I have ever had with a company and I will make sure all of my colleagues and friends know of this experience.  I understand that you don't really care about giving good customer service to your ex customers, but I assure you make a fatal error when you assume those people will not share there experience with current and future potential customers.

If you are bored and don't have anything to do, please look for things to do that are work related.  This is a good time to improve your skills and learn about things you are not absolutely proficient in.  Read some options books, study macros in the P&L's, etc.  The key phrase here is work to improve your skills so that we can shake off some of the rust we have developed in the last month.  All of this is coming from Goss and it is serious, to be a part of the new company you have to show that you are willing to contribute and are the best of the best.  I know this sounds harsh, but we have all had a nice vacation and I am sure most of you are like me and looking forward to not having such a boring job.  It looks as though bidders will be in this week, so we will have some reports and demonstrations to give.  Please pull me aside or email me if you have any further questions.Thanks and Happy New Year.PL

I hope everyone understands how bad this makes our entire team look.  This issue continues to be brought up in the staff meeting and we are always the cause of it.  This is the second time in less than a week and we have gone over this several times.  Next time this happens, someone is liable to get an exit early pass from the floor for good.  To keep this from happening we will now practice the following Rule:Anytime a price desk deal that involves the central desk needs to be changed, the person that runs the central book will not leave the floor until Errol or Joey tells you that there book is ok.  If that happens to be midnight, sorry.  That is the rule and there will be absolutely no exceptions.  Sorry I have to be a jerk, but it is obvious that being nice about it has not worked.

The students that appear in the pictures from Halloween dressed in racial costumes should be immediately expelled from the University and their respective fraternities should be permanently removed from campus.  We also think that PartyPics.com should be disciplined and removed from the vendor list for the University.  Auburn University and it's related organizations should not contribute money to organizations that are willing to take pictures of such insulting behavior and try and profit from them by selling them to disgusting human beings that would participate in such offensive behavior.As graduates of Auburn University and Athletic and Academic Scholarship donors, we are appalled by these students behavior and demand immediate action be taken against them.  The longer this issue is not dealt with, the worse our University looks in the eyes of the world.  Please take action and help save Auburn's reputation.
