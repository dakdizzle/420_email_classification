The question is:  How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do not	double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths (i.e. nom on same contract	from (1) Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from (2) Bushton Outlet to Demac)	For Nominating purposes:	MDQ of contract = Primary Firm + Alternate Firm up to the MDQ. 	Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate.	Point MDQ needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point.	EXAMPLE:	If the Field MDQ is 10,000, then we will  (1) total the reciepts nominated on the	contract; (2) compare the total nominated to the Contract MDQ.  Then the shipper	will get firm (primary and alternate) up to their contract MDQ.  Anything over will be 	overrun at IT rate.	If anyone has any other questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

Gerry	if you are not the person to help us on this, please let me know who.  Also in talking	with Mary Darveaux she said if you use the same contract at the inlet and outlet of	Bushton, you DO double your MDQ.  Therefore, if you have 10,000 MDQ you can 	only nominate 5,000 to inlet and 5,000 at outlet.  	Gerry, can we run a quick report to see if there are any contracts that are identical	on the inlet and outlet of Bushton?

After November 1, Measurement would NO longer adjust any TBS physical	                 volumes unless there was a PPA directly influencing said TBS.		2.  Measurement would check  to see if they had a deduct meter they were	                 using in the end user process. (Since the meeting we have discovered that	 	     the deduct meter IS in GVA, therefore no checking needs to be done).		3.  Gas Logistics would check with IT on possible enhancement (if necessary) for		     negative volumes to the TBS.  (We have talked with IT and this would be		     a major enhancement and have to be done with the new system).		4.  Procedures need to be documented to handle negative numbers created by		     the LDC giving measurement an end user actual volume greater than the 		     TBS connected to NNG.		5.  Measurement and Gas Logistics agreed that all measured volumes including		     End User point volumes would be "housed' in PGAS.	After further discussions in Gas Logistics, our recommendation is that neither Measurement or Gas Logistics accomodate a	negative number.  If the LDC gives measurement an end user volume greater than the TBS the following should happen:		1.  Measurement should either:			a.  Call the LDC and let them know they cannot accept a volume at an end			     user point higher than their TBS.			b.  Or Measurement can call Jodie Floyd on the Gas Logistics Measurement Desk			     and Jodie will call LDC with the same info.		2.  If Measurement does not get an answer before measurement close, then measurement will		     use the number equal to the TBS for the end user point.	Gary and Ellis, you may want to have more discussions on this topic.  I would be glad to regroup if you want.	I have put a call into Marketing to talk to them about our concerns on this issue.  Also Raetta and Jodie are	 going to go ahead and call Wisconsin Gas and get their explanation of why an end user point would be	greater than the TBS.  Hopefully it is just a measurement error.  We will let you know the outcome.	If there is something I missed, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

Thanks. Lynn	We met with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for	November 1.  Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW:	1.  SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless	     they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas 	     day (during all cycles).  (Good news for TW)	2.  SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750.  If they do, they will	     maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there	     are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW)	   	4.  SoCal will have the option to call OFO's at the beginning of each cycle	     for the gas day.  Today they only call an OFO before the gas day begins.	     Starting Nov. 1, they can call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle,	     including Intraday 1 and Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This	     will be a major impact to SoCal's customers)	5.  SoCal says the "windowing" is gone.  But, they are still giving us a	     capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations	     exceed their capacity.	6.  SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation.  This	     would be due to SoCal's market not burning their schedule.  At that	     time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn.	Overall, our process does not change. If you have any questions, please	let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW:	1.  SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless	     they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas 	     day (during all cycles).  (Good news for TW)	2.  SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750.  If they do, they will	     maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there	     are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW)	   	4.  SoCal will have the option to call OFO's at the beginning of each cycle	     for the gas day, which could cause a confirmation reduction.  Today they	     only call an OFO before the gas day begins.   Starting Nov. 1, they can 	     call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle, including Intraday 1 and 	     Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This will be a major impact	     to SoCal's customers)	5.  SoCal says the "windowing" is gone.  But, they are still giving us a	     capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations	     exceed their capacity.	6.  SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation.  This	     would be due to SoCal's market not burning their schedule.  At that	     time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn.	Overall, our process does not change. If you have any questions, please	let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

Through our discussions, here are a few ideas including some	of yesterday's discussion.  These ideas may be somewhat out of the norm, but we thought we	would at least  throw them on the table.	1.  If Oneok cannot supply these deliveries, then Oneok should agree with us to lift the requirement	     that the supply has to be upstream of the delivery in the Bushton Universe.  It can still be	     required in the "Bushton Universe", just not as restrictive as it is today.	2.  If Oneok cannot supply these deliveries, then Oneok should allow us to do storage true ups	     at 8:00 a.m. at the end of the gas day to eliminate DDVC.	3.  If these deliveries are on Firm contracts, can we sell them SMS to cover these small volumes	     even though they are in the field area?	4.  Richfield Storage point - (I am not sure it is even active)  -  Could we get Oneok to agree to 	     allow true ups if we are supplying the true up with gas coming from the Richfield storage point?	     I am sure this alternative would need to include the storage group.	We would be glad to participate in any future discussions.  Thanks. Lynn

Beginning with June billing for May production, we are billing FTS-2 reservation invoices onJune 1 instead of May 31.  At some point in time we may move back to the last day of the month.  This would be after we have (1) automated the manual process or (2) managed to speed up the manual process to effectivelycapture the scheduled volumes for the last day of the month.  Hope I have not confused the issue for you.  If you have any other questions, please let me knowThanks. LynnFrom:	Teb Lokey/ENRON@enronXgate on 05/29/2001 02:48 PMTo:	Ray Volpone/ENRON@enronXgatecc:	Wendy Koh/ENRON@enronXgate, Hilda Lindley/FGT/Enron@ENRON, Lynn Blair/ET&S/Enron@ENRON Subject:	RE: Determination of Invoice Date/Due dateRay - The only tariff provisions state that "Transporter shall render  invoices to Shippers no later than the tenth (10th) day of the month following the month to which the charges or credits apply ..." (Sheet 134).  The payment provisions (also on Sheet 134) state that "Unless otherwise agreed, Shipper shall pay Transporter ...on or before the tenth (10th) day after written transmission of ivoice..." .There is nothing else in the tariff which could be used to programatically determine invoice dates but the invoice due date would be 10 days after the invoice is transmitted.  In discussions with market services,  I believe that they intend to send out the FTS-2 reservation invoices on the first day of the month rather than the last day of the production month because of complications in administering some rate cap provisions agreed to in the Phase IV Settlement.  Sorry I couldn't be of more help.  -  Teb

BUFORD CONFIRMATIONSLynn,  can we setup a few minutes to discuss the Ft. Buford confirmation processes.  NBPL is wanting to discontinue faxes for Ft. Buford and the ID2 faxes for all NBPL points.  This would require either NBPL or NNG dialing into the others system to confirm (Ft, Buford each cycle) and to verify the final ID2 scheduled numbers daily.  We need to discuss if NNG is willing to make this a practice or not.  I will have Ava setup a time on your calendar some time or get with me early some morning.  We need to see what direction we want to go.  								j.  floyd

Jesus DripDebbie Moseley called me a few weeks ago about the Mt. Jesus drip.  Oneok is not giving NNG Btu replacement for the hydrocarbon liquid being hauled from the Mt. Jesus location.  The imbalance is approaching $60,000, and Oneok seems unwilling to change their position.  Oneok claims that the hauler is not paying them for liquid, but is writing water on the ticket.  I sampled the liquid and sent Oneok (John Hanna) a copy of the analysis, showing the liquid as drip, not water.  In the past, I know that we did not push Oneok on this issue because of the Bushton measurement dispute.  Now that the Bushton measurement dispute is near settlement, should this Mt. Jesus issue be addressed?  There are at least two other Oneok liquid issues that need to be addressed:  1.  Oneok is receiving payment at Hemphill #3 for liquid, and this gas does not go to Bushton (Sammy Williams may have more detail on this issue).2.  Sublette liquid is condensate, and it is being called water on the ticket.Do you have any ideas on how to proceed?  We do not seem to be able to get the issue resolved at this level.  Thanks.

In order to balance to your monthly Confirmation Letter that Northern sends I have made some changes to the spreadsheets to make it easier for both of us to identify the cumulative imbalance by contract.As per our phone conversation the Burdett (17378) point was sold to Golden Belt Transport, LLC, effective 2/1/01 but, the imbalance volumes are still being placed under your OBA contract.  I amworking with others here at Northern to get this corrected.Currently I have identified that Oneok owns Northern $2,401,128.62 on all the OBA contracts (Ellis-Woodward-Clark OBA's=$316,846.96 due NNG; Delhi Beaver OBA=$171,781.26 due Oneok;Orignial OBAs = $2,212,211.59 due NNG).  It was stated that both parties would cash-in/out the imbalances on the Original OBA contracts, on a quarterly basis.  At this time I am requesting that wecash-in/out the Original OBA's and the Delhi Beaver OBA since, Oneok no longer operates the point.Please take a moment and review the volumes and dollars on the spreadsheets.  If you have anyconcerns please let me know but, if you are in agreement would you please let me know when Northern can expect to receive payment.

For printing Source Path and Allocation Path reports during the Allocation Process, the print function 		     should be set at permanent default of legal and landscape.  This would be a real time saver when 		    checking the allocated points for uncalled for cuts.	b.  Customers would like to have subtotals by point and a grand total  on the storage daily activity report 		     (IDD/PNR Contract Balance).  We now have the grouping to sum function, but I think this is too  time 	     consuming for our customers.	c.  In the Scheduled Quantities listings, instead of the box which now says "No cuts were found in this 		     cycle.  Do you want to continue checking?"  I think the notice for Final AM should be expanded to say 	    "Did you submit new nominations for the Final AM Cycle?  If not, please view Intraday 2 for any 		     possible cuts."  Since so few of our customers actually use the Final AM Cycle, I think this would be 		     helpful to our customers who are frequently under severe time restraints and stress when trying to 		     figure out what went wrong.  	d.  I would like a serious investigation into the time required to do manual scheduling.  The slowness of 		     the system for this procedure is tortuous.   It is also a  serious time waster.Please advise if you need further information.Janet McDanielx3-1936

The judge recommended to the commission that the companies be fined $2,000 per day retroactive to May 8 and lasting until they comply with the commission order. Oneok and its subsidiaries claim the information is proprietary and that the commission has no legal right to have access to its unregulated gas sales transactions. The matter is expected to go before the full commission later this month. OCC Public Utility Division Director Ernest Johnson called the companies continued refusal to allow access to the documents "mystifying." "They have twice tried unsuccessfully to have the Oklahoma Supreme Court stop staff in its attempt to get the documents. Now they have simply refused to turn over the documents. A paid witness for Oneok recently testified that the dealings between Oneok subsidiaries and ONG were arms-length competitive transactions, and the resulting charges were fair, just, and reasonable. One would think Oneok would be anxious to show staff that such was actually the case, and that the decisions made were in the best interest of the consumer," said Johnson. "This is simply a case of commission staff trying to get the information needed to ascertain whether the customers of a regulated monopoly (ONG) paid a fair, just and reasonable price for their natural gas this past winter." John said the commission staff received numerous complaints from gas customers struggling with high gas bills this past winter. They best illustrate the reason behind the staff's request for documents from companies owned by Oneok, the parent company of ONG, he said in an earlier statement. "It is the Commission's responsibility and obligation to review and determine whether ONG's customers are paying no more for gas than the law allows. Staff is simply trying to do that. It is regrettable Oneok apparently does not see fit to work cooperatively with OCC staff to strengthen the public's confidence in the utility and the regulatory process. Its refusal to turn over data related to gas transactions of its subsidiaries further undermines a public confidence already badly shaken by the gas crisis."

I only included on the address list the ones that I could think of off the top of my head who regularly attend the meeting, so please don't think I've limited the list and please pass this on to the others who attend. The microphones in Houston are extremely sensitive to any noise. Paper shuffling is the biggest problem. Even "straightening" papers or turning a page has the effect of blocking out the speakers voice. Gas Dailies should be left at your desk. Whispering can also be heard. It tends to make it very difficult to hear in Omaha. It is also imperative that the microphone be put very near the person who speaking, particularly if their voice doesn't carry. I don't quite understand when it can pick up whispers, but can't pick up a softer speaker's voice, but that's the way it is. I think if we are all aware of that, we can greatly enhance the quality of the meeting for the Omaha participants. thanks sj

Since it went through our meter, the customer is going to get credit for this gas and transportation, which he should not. We need to get this situation stopped. They should blow gas upstream of the meter.  Gary, can you check with Bandel and get an approximate volume that has been vented? Richard, great job in bringing this to our attention. sjGary Spraggins06/01/2001 01:04 PMTo:	Steven January/ET&S/Enron@Enroncc:	 Subject:	Warren EuniceIt was brought to my attention this last weekend that when Warren Eunice goes sour and our valve shuts, there is a blow off valve down stream of our measurement that Warren  personnel are using to vent the sour gas until it turns sweet. So, while they are venting the gas we still show flow of 8,000 to 10,000 which is measured as if we received the gas. I have notified Bob Bandel and he is looking into the situation. They were not aware that this was happening. Richard brought this to my attention.Gary<Embedded StdOleLink><Embedded StdOleLink><Embedded StdOleLink>

With the latest Commodity Close, the A/R will total $528,445.91, which includes a PPA in the amount of $171,217.80 (February).  This will be rolling on to the 30 days' Customer report very shortly.Earlier this spring, discussions were held with Loren and Frank regarding Terra's contract #104684 and December's transportation invoice.  Scheduled quantities reports for December 2000 through February 2001 were sent for their review.  The decision was made to repath the December Reservation in order to revise the base/variable volumes which resulted in a PPA in the amount of $175,507.80.  A PPA form was signed by all parties and forwarded accordingly.  In early March, we determined we had monies due Terra and after discussions with Loren, it was agreed we would net all invoices currently on the A/R -- this included the December PPA.   Bill Fowler had talked to TransCanada and left a detailed voicemail for Audie Bremmer, Terra.  The net monies wired to Terra totaled $295,155.36.In late March, Loren advised us to repath the February Reservation in order to revise the base/variable volumes which resulted in a PPA in the amount of $171,217.80.  A PPA form was signed by all parties for this one as well.  There was no reason to repath January 2001.In April, Kathy tried to telephone Audie who would not return her call.  His message to her, through his assistant (Maggie), was that he would not pay any invoice without a telephone call from Frank.  This was relayed to Loren and he relayed same to Frank.  As a side note, Frank had seen Audie at some industry function fairly recently and had tried to call Audie -- Audie had not returned his calls.  In last week's followup with Loren, he relayed that Frank had visited with Dave Neubauer on this issue, and the feeling was that December was closed and we would waive February.  However, Bill Fowler feels February should still stand.  Loren shared there was a similar deal with Minnegasco and they had to pay the revised invoice.  If we allowed the February to be waived, TransCanada would relay that info to Minnegasco.I plan to talk to Loren again mid-week to update this issue to see if he and Frank feel the timing is acceptable for us to contact Audie.  Should anyone have any questions or suggestions, please advise -- will be in the office 6:30 a.m.-3:30 p.m. this week. Thanks,S.

She had spotted a spider that had dropped down on a drag line.  That's when we decided to help Karen get over her phobia.

Their other alternative is to Pool to Mid 16A pool using MPS for free and then the downstream shipper would have to pay fuel and commodity when they take it away (netting a lower price to Duke).  I don't know if they are meeting some obligation for Tailgate gas using Pony gas as an option.  Let me know what you would like to do.Thanks!

As longas that block is in place, we are OK with Duke using 16A for pooling purposes.Hopefully this answers your question.  If not let me know.  Thanks.

This will be a slight change for our customers.  Currently during the processes for example, the evening process, SBS is available during the Rollover, Allocation and Confirmation process, and turned off during the Storage Allocation process.  With this change SBS will only be available during the Rollover and Allocation process and remain off during the Storage Allocation and Confirmation process, if a storage allocation is necessary.

Several questionshave come up over the weekend.  The weekend crew is documenting thequestions.  I have left Mike Bodnar and John Buchanan a phone mail messageto research the questions and concerns on Monday.  Then we will group withstorage and determine what changes need to be made.One change we talked about on the Sunday morning call with storage is tobe able to use SBS on the non allocated portion of storage.  ie, if we areallocating injections, then withdrawals should still use SBS.  If we are allocatingwithdrawals, then injections should still have access to SBS.  Mike Bodnar willpursue this enhancement further.  Thanks.

This will be a slight change for our customers.  Currently during the processes for example, the evening process, SBS is available during the Rollover, Allocation and Confirmation process, and turned off during the Storage Allocation process.  With this change SBS will only be available during the Rollover and Allocation process and remain off during the Storage Allocation and Confirmation process, if a storage allocation is necessary.  I am unsure how you would want to communicate this to your customers.  Also, Jill will be working on these changes over the weekend, and have Joe confirm her change by Monday the 18th.  Changes should be available for production by Tuesday the 19th.

All of this gas is going to WGR and none of it returns to NNG.  So this was communicated last year when all this was being planned.The OBA was not affected with this sell.  The OBA with WGR is one OBA that totalled all points.  They owe us 107,000 dth at the end of last month and we owe them 36,000 dth for fuel usage on the #5 unit at Gomez for the first five months of the year.  All that will be left on WGR's OBA will be Benedum and Midkiff.  Dan Ball and I are working together and hope to have the OBA near zero by the end of July.I hope this answers your questions, if not let me know.Randy<Embedded StdOleLink>

On NNG, we are trying to ensure new or existing meters do NOT come on without	a schedule volume to ensure proper billing.  Since TBS' on NNG do not always have a scheduled 	volume tied to it, we may need to ensure the volume is covered at the Zone level by the shipper.  	Do you think this is something the Measurement Desk could help the field with?  We certainly	would be glad to help in any way on the scheduling side. This is especially important for new meters	as we go through the billing process.  	Just a thought.  Thanks. Lynn

High level	recap is:		130,000		Due to building line pack from Monday's gas day		 95,000		Day to Day payback and I/C shortages ( the bulk of this was to					repay Norval and Valero Sprayberry about 60,000 from					the previous day)		140,000		Due to Market Area overtake (this includes 40,000 of Mid Am imbalance					plus 100,000 spread over ABC, D and EF.  In looking at LSF, we					were not able to determine that any one zone over pulled.  It looked					to be pretty evenly distributed)		 15,000		Due to 5% tolerance on Power packs.		_______		380,000		The total swing was 419,000.  The difference of 39,000 is a combination					operational adjustments.	Hopefully this helps to identify some of your concerns.  If you have any questions, please let me	know.  Thanks. Lynn

John concentrates on NNG North end and testing since he will be on 42 with the NNG team		Mike concentrates on NNG South end and testing since he will be on 42 with the NNG team	As each of you are on vacation, then the other 2 will cover your area.

Please let me know of any changes or corrections and I will make them then send to Virginia Power.	Greg, here are the questions and answers that we promised you from the conference call on Tuesday,	November 6.  Please review and let Vernon or I know if you need any clarification.	1.  What fields can be changed on a nomination and the nomination still keep its flowing gas rights from the previous cycle?		Answer - (1) QUANTITY volume equal to scheduled amount or volume lower than scheduled amount			  (2) RANK changed to a different number	2.  Where can I find information on Imbalance Tiering in relation to mandatory monthly cash out?		Answer - Tariff Sheet 267.D & E (Raetta, so you agree?)	3.  What points are in the grouping to determine a demarc allocation?		Answer - Beatrice (Trailblazer) and demarc are the only two points in the group	4.  If Virgina Power is transporting gas to demarc and demarc is allocated, can Virginia Power	     switch their nomination to demarc deferred delivery and keep their gas flowing?		Answer - The field Receipt to demarc deffered delivery IS included in a demarc allocation			  because the transport tied to this storage nomination is physically coming from		              the field to the market area. (Greg we may not have been clear on this comment			  on the conference call)

We started this report after switching to allocations before confirmations	so we could track any possible "holes" in the pipe. 	So far the new process is working well and we were thinking about discontinuing this report	unless you need it for Stan's meeting?  Remember we give you the Socal Window and scheduled volumes 	as well as the west of thoreau scheduled volumes on the weekend notes.	Thanks. Lynn

Please give me a call if you have	any questions. (713-853-7637).  	1.  Number 4 is still a little fuzzy.  Does Demarc Deferred get allocated during the same cycles as Demarc?		Answer:  Yes	2.   Seems unlikely since Demarc Deferred is a storage point and storage is allocated at a different time?		Answer:  A transportation delivery directly to Demarc Deferred is a part of the Demarc allocation.  			  When NNG looks at a storage allocation, we review all the injections (or withdrawals)	 		  at the storage point.  The two referenced allocations are done seperately, but during the same			  cycle.	3.  If we were nominating our Firm from Beatrice to Demarc Deferred where would our customers pull from?		Answer:  Customers can pick up gas at Demarc Deferred	4.  The storage that is offered by NNG's park and ride is at what location?  Demarc or Demarc Deferred?		Answer:  Demarc Deferred	Hopefully this helped.  Thanks. Lynn

Are you comfortable with it	before I send it to the shipper.  Thanks. Lynn	Answer:  If an interruptible shipper is bumped in the Intraday 1	         cycle, the shipper will keep 1/3 of their scheduled volumes.	         Shippers schedule becomes their actual unless they are the		   operator of the point.  Therefore, they would not encounter	         a DDVC penalty.  If the Shipper is the operator, NNG looks at		   total scheduled volumes vs total actual delivered volumes and determines		   if a DDVC is appropriate.  The DDVC is based on the difference		   between total scheduled and the actual delivery at the point.  	If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.
