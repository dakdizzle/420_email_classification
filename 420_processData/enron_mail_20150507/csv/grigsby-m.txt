I believe that they claimed a penalty on the net out for the amount.  We do not agree with this short pay and stand by the description of the Socal product in which it states that there will be cuts due to operational constraints on the upstream pipelines.  I would like to return the short pay favor to Texaco.  Please let me know how we should proceed.Mike Grigsby

It is a good old boy network that colludes against every day and every month.  In this case, the "club" is Reliant, Williams, Duke and others who own TW transport to SJ from Ignacio.  Our TW transport expires in Dec, so for Enron to bid firm 100% flow in the SJ, we have to price it at a discount because of the cuts through Bondad on El Paso.  We could bid higher if it was average flows or we had TW firm transport.

It would be helpful for our desk to sit down with John Arnold and John Lavorato to openly discuss the importance of continuing to increase liquidity on EOL. I would also like to put to rest the notion that increasing liquidity leads to negative P&L and that a Trader's support of EOL liquidity will go unrecognized at year end PRC. Please email me with a response of when we could set up such a meeting. Sincerely,Mike Grigsby

I would then like columns set up that allow Monte to enter post ids for all hedge strips for prior day and new day.  We should then sum the net change of the two and balance against the columns summing the new deals that I enter each day.  This method should give us another way of checking if all new deals are being booked properly.  Please meet with Keith Holst to discuss how to set up the sheet.  He has a similar process of checkking new deals.  Once this is set up, please have each bookrunner adopt the same prcatice with their trader.   I would like Anne to be responsible for seeing that this new process is in place for next week's business. I understand that the standard for most deals is 5000/d and that this can lead to booking 50000/d at this volume.  We need to have Anne set up a trader deal sheet that lists the volume and price in a clear and legible format for all bookrunners.   Thanks,Mike
