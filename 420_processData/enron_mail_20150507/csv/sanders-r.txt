Two of FERC's five positions (both Republican or Independent) are vacant, but soon to be filled by nominated candidates.  Both nominees (Pat Wood and Nora Brownell) are expected to be helpful to our interests.   If we suceed in getting a U.S. district court judge to sollicit FERC's view befor the  two new nominees are seated, there may be a slight risk that members of Congress will hold their nominations hostage over the issue of how FERC answers the court.I have copied Linda Robertson, the head of Enron's Washington shop, so that she can assess how real this risk is and whether it should influence our timing.

The company has said they need to keep the old accounting convention alive, as it would bolster their chance for recovery in the litigation on the just and reasonable argument in Federal District Court.

No need to thank me,just send me gifts.  Seriously, I talked this morning with Tom Hall and we agreed that Ecogas would pay him $53,000.  Hall has agreed to release Enron, Ecogas, Maffett and every affiliate, related party and subsidiary.  He will also release any and all patent issues. The goal is for him to move on with his life and for us to move on as well.  I have asked Doug Daniels to prepare the settlement papers reflecting such an agreement.

Hennegan is askingfor something in the "high $20s"  I am advised that the settlement group isprepared to go to the high teens, but it is not clear how much further.I do not know the allocation of the $13 million among Natwest and McDonald,except that I believe that Natwest is NOT paying the lion's share, as onemight expect.If the bargaining proceeds, I am sure that someone will ask Enron tocontribute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ................................................ALSCHULER GROSSMAN STEIN & KAHAN LLPATTORNEYS AT LAWwww.agsk.com2049 Century Park EastThirty-Ninth FloorLos Angeles, CA 90067-3213Tel 310-277-1226Fax 310-552-6077This transmission is intended only for the useof the addressee and may contain informationthat is privileged, confidential and exempt fromdisclosure under applicable law.

Calpine		Andy:	To recap our conversation yesterday, here is where we stand on the Calpinematter.	I made our settlement offer of $1 million to Tom Ganucheau by telephone onFriday, May 18. Tom told me that his client contact was out of the officeuntil May 23 or 24 but that he would relay the offer as quickly as he could.I spoke with Tom again by telephone last week and he volunteered that he was"working on" getting me a reply.	We have had 3 minor successes in pretrial skirmishing that may make asettlement offer more attractive at this time. First, we won our motion tocompel, which requires that Calpine produce abstracts of all its powerpurchase and sale agreements in all NERC regions. They had moved for aprotective order which would limit their production to the contracts inERCOT. Their expanded production is due June 11. Second, we won our motionto continue or extend the deadline to reply to Calpine's motion for summaryjudgment. We filed a reply anyway out of an abundance of caution, but thecourt ruled that we were entitled to additional time, partly becasue of itsruling on expanding the scope of contract discovery outside ERCOT. Oursupplemental reply to the summary judgment motion is due June 22.  Third,Calpine lost on its motion to compel, in which they had sought an order fromthe court requiring us to produce additional information on our damageclaim. You should have a copy of our reply to Calpine's motion, in which wedetailed the evidence already produced on damages. We still need to updatesome of the damage claim based on information that came out in Ed Baughman'sdeposition, and Bonnie is working with Doug Gilbert-Smith on this.	Elizabeth Sager's deposition is scheduled for June 13. Jim Fallon'sdeposition is scheduled for June 14. A prep session for Sager is scheduledfor June 7; a prep session for Fallon is scheduled for June 12. In additionto the pleading and discovery deadlines noted above, we also have a pleadingamendment deadline on June 20, and an expert report deadline of June 29. Wehave already met with Ron Vollmar about producing his expert report. We havedrafted an amended complaint, which we needed to do anyway since the casewas removed from state court and we were still on the state court originalpetition. The amended complaint will add a specific count pleadingambiguity/implied contract, to bolster the admissability of extrinsicevidence, and a promissory estoppel claim in the alternative.	I will let you know as soon as I hear anything in response to oursettlement offer, and in the meantime, please don't hesitiate to call if youhave questions or comments on any of these matters.	Best regards,	Bill

Charles Thompson, Enron Corp., and Enron Corp. d/b/a Houston Pipeline Company, Cause No. 2001-21283, in the 333rd District Court of Harris County, Texas.  The lawsuit was filed on May 7, 2001, and Charles Thompson (an Enron employee) was served on May 23, 2001.  This case is a car wreck negligence case in which the plaintiff is claiming back and neck injuries as a result of allegedly been hit by a vehicle driven by Charles Thompson in the course and scope of his employment for Enron/HPL.  I am going to take care of it, and give it to Eilee Kisluk because of the insurance issues involved.

Cogen, et al.; Roger Atkinson v. JEDI Linde=n and NEPCO.=09This morning I received a copy of service of process that was served on Cog=en Technologies Linden Venture in the Roger Atkinson matter.  Cogen Technol=ogies Linden Venture had previously been served with a summons and complain=t in the Atkinson matter in mid April.  I forwarded the matter to El Paso E=nergy Company, who had purchased ENA's interest in the Cogen companies effe=ctive late February 2001.  El Paso retained Ed Fanning of McCarter & Englis=h to represent Cogen's interests.  We have worked with Ed in other Cogen ma=tters before, and I have found him to be both effective and efficient.  Thi=s matter relates to personal injuries allegedly suffered by Atkinson while =working at a construction site at the Linden facility in December 2000.  Da=vid Waterson of El Paso recently called me concerning potential defense and= indemnity obligations that El Paso believes NEPCO may owe Cogen with respe=ct to this incident.  We will need to review NEPCO's contract with Cogen to= determine if any such obligations exist.The document that I received today is a Notice of Motion to Consolidate and= to Compel Inspection.  This motion seeks to consolidate the Atkinson v. Co=gen case with a case that was apparently also filed in New Jersey state cou=rt as Roger Atkinson v. JEDI Linden and NEPCO and to compel an inspection o=f the construction site where the accident allegedly occurred.  I have aske=d Becky Stephens whether we have received service of process on either JEDI= Linden or NEPCO.  To date, we have not.  However, I expect that service of= process is in the works, and I have asked Becky to be on the look out for =it.

By the way, although I have not invited you and Dave to come to Portland on the 3rd, you are welcome. I am not sure it is the best use of your time. I am flying to SF to meet w/ Gary on the day of the 3rd to catch up on FERC issues You may want to come to that.
