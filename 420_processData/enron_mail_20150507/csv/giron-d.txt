Anything over that is taxed at 55%, but you are allowed deductions such as debts, probate fees, funeral expenses, and any state estate or inheritance taxes.  So the effective rate will be a little lower.  The increase to $1 million will not take effect until 2006.  This is very basic information, estate planning should be handled by a professional to minimize the tax liability.  Obviously, if the estate is not worth much money, then no taxes will be owed.  I'm sure these professionals are highly compensated because they have the ability to save millions of dollars to some of their clients.Chris loves it when you are at his games.

My son had a baseball game and I had been out of town over the weekends lately so we sold the tickets.  They did look pretty good, and could have really blown them out if Sims had been just a little more accurate in the second half.  But I'm not complaining.  I think Brown really made a mistake by going with Ivan Williams against OK.  He is just too slow hitting the hole against a defense like that.  I think the next three are locks.  Then it comes down to T+1.  I don't care how average they may be, UT has won exactly 1 game at Kyle since 1983 (8 games).  Texas should be very good next year.  The only problem area I see is the OL.  I just sent an email to Kyle about lunch.  Let's do it.ENE is a piece of shit.  That's really all there is to say about that.DG

It's trading at $16.  Remember in March we got out at $71.  My options are now $68 out of the money and it will be at least 3 years before they will approach breakeven.  If I seem depressed lately, that's why.  Anyway, I love you.D

Let me know what else I need to do.ThanksDGI managed all back office issues of an asset management deal with Brooklyn Union Gas Company.  It was a two year deal in which Enron was assigned all of the utilities' assets (supply contracts, transportation contracts, and storage contracts) and then became responsible for providing 100% of the gas requirements of BUG.  I was involved in the negotiations to sign the deal, mostly working with the supply group of BUG doing due diligence on their contracts.  I created a complex invoice model and worked with our trading group, our logistics group, our risk management group, and gas accounting group.  In addition, I made monthly trips to New York to manage the customer and take care of any issues.  It was a $24MM/Year deal.  I was the point person on this deal and worked on it for a year and a half before handing it off to someone else when I moved to risk.I was involved in another asset management deal with Peoples Gas Company in Chicago.  I also did due diligence work and was involved in negotiations on the deal.  I also created invoice models.  I did not do the day to day work because I was on my way to risk management.  We started a joint venture with Peoples in Chicago.  I set up the risk management department and managed all mid and back office issues of the joint venture.  I managed two book administrators who worked in the Chicago office and made monthly visits to address any issues.  This office made $12MM in its first year and we had no issues from a risk management or accounting perspective.I took over managing the West desk in risk when there was a $10MM flash to actual variance in the region.  Flash to actual is the difference between the reported P&L and the GL.  Within 3 months I had identified the variances and cleared them.  On a going forward basis I kept the variance at zero.  I identified problems in scheduling that were causing these variances and took proactive steps to fix the problem.  After managing the desk for 6 months, I was able to have everyone cross trained on other books.  This resulted in me being able to reduce the staff by one, saving the company approx $100K/Year.

mike.fultz@halliburton.com,mike.fultz@halliburton.com,mike.fultz@halliburton.com,Subject: RE: What's up?,Mike,In my opinion Onkyo is just a better quality product than Kenwood, thus the price discrepancy.  I (and this is just me) would not buy a Kenwood.  I would buy Onkyo, Denon, Yamaha, or Harman Kardon.  These are more expensive, but I think better than Sony, Kenwood, JVC, Technics, and Pioneer.  The Onkyo 696 is a great receiver.  And I know you can beat the Crutchfield price.  The sites I would check out are onecall.com, soundcity.com, jandr.com, hifi.com.  You also need to look at audioreview.com.  You can see other peoples opinions of products they have actually purchased.  It is a great site.  They will also indicate where they purchased the equipment and how much they paid.  On those sites to buy that I mentioned, you need to call and talk to someone.  They will give you a better price than advertised on the internet.  Give me a call @ 713-853-9573.  I leave for Chicago later this afternoon.DG

My boat is on a lift out of the water.  In the morning it was floating.  Their dock is underwater.  I've never seen anything like it.  I hope everyone over there is alright.
