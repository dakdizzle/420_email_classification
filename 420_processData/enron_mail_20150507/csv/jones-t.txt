We've got a few issues here.  First, we just can replace profiles.  If it is a simple a a name change or some mergers, maybe.  Is this?  If it's not, we may have to assign the trades over.  I know I've got a financial master with BP Exploration & Oil Inc.  I just can't move the profile.What's the scoop here?  I have no records of a name change/merger here, do you?

Send all requests for NDAs by email directly to me, Tana Jones2.  The email should contain the correct legal name of the company and its address3.  I will need a brief description of the nature of the business/project you are discussing with the customer4.  Generally we will send out a bilateral NDA, but there are instances where only Enron is providing confidential information, and we prefer to use that form whenever possible as it is much more favorable to Enron.  Please indicate when you think you have such a situation.5.  We have found it most helpful to send the NDAs to the counterparties by email directly from Legal.  I have a email letter that states:  "At the request of "dealmaker name" I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement. If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-3397 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you."  If you prefer, we can email the NDA to you to go out under you cover letter, or send it by fax or UPS.  Just let me know and I will do so.  Otherwise, I will email it as it speeds things up.6.  Please indicate any special timing concerns (i.e., it needs to go out today, by lunch, we have a meeting Wednesday, whatever).  Generally they go out within 1-2 days of receipt of your email.Upon receipt of this information I will do the conflicts check, prepare the NDA, and log the NDA into the list I keep of the Enron Credit Inc. NDAs.  I hope this will make for a smooth process!  Thanks for your assistance.

Among the issues we are concerned with are whether Confidentiality Agreements are enforceable in Australian courts, should we include our standard arbitration provision and would such provision be enforceable or would we be better off getting the customer to submit to the jurisdiction of the NY courts, and lastly are there any other provisions we should be putting in the agreement.  When you have a minute we would be most appreciative of your input.  I have attached the form of Confidentiality Agreement we propose to submit to our customer.

It is not a place to dump general legal negotiation stuff.  Examples would be:  "masters limited to natural gas or crude oil trading only", "no payment netting between energy commodity and interest rate and currency transactions", "no oral trades allowed", "only the treasurer can enter to trades for the company", "all agreements for this counterparty require two signatures".  You can do a sort on the PENDING SWAP UPDATE - EXECUTED, which will then show you all the restrictions, then scroll down and look at the type of restrictions entered into for the different companies to get a flavor for these types of restrictions.  But we don't want to junk it up with general legal negotiation stuff.  Just critical, DON'T TRADE UNLESS YOU LOOK AT THIS STUFF.
