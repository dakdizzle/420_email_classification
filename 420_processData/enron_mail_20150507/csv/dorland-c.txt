Houston has requested that we make lists of all applications that we use and also that we consolidate all of the files (models and data) that are critical to our business (I don't think MP3's count) into one directory on the network. This is so that these items can be included in the proposed deal with newco. The Calgary Trading group has set up a directory on I:/trading/newco and I think if each group did the same that would be great. Each group should probably have one person in charge of the directory so there isn't any overlap. Call me with any ?'s/Thanx Chris

mike.grigsby@enron.com,mike.grigsby@enron.com,mike.grigsby@enron.com,Subject: RE: Shut - In costs,X-FileName: chris dorland 6-26-02.PSTGrigs,I talked to Lambie (our resident produciton and reserve expert) about this and he thought it was highly unlikely that producers would shut in eastern rocks production for a couple of reasons. Apparently, if you shut in coal bed methane production there is a serious risk that the well will "water out" either ruining the well or causing 6 months to a year of production delays. Also, it seem logistically unlikely due to the small production volumes associated with each individual well (100-500 mm/d). In Chris's opinion coal bed methane would be some of the last production we would ever see shut in. Hope this helps. Let me know if you learn anything further.Chris

Total approximately $10000 CND.Hardly seems like the best option.Also, I called Williams moving to find out what the cost was to move me down here last year. And the invoice just for the move of my household goods from Calgary to Houston was $4700 USD. Just off the top of my head my out of pocket costs will be:Movers = $7300 CND (4700 USD)Flight = $1500 CNDHotel = $1500 CNDOctober Rent = $1500 (I have a 1 year lease in Houston that expires at the end of October)The total of the above is $11 800.

What is with people (that article) ? Working long hours just for the sake of working long hours. I am pushing for a 4 day work week. Why Calgary? Why not? I love Calgary. Actually the guy that ran our trading operation in Calgary is getting married to an American who works in Houston so he is moving to accommodate her career. This has left a hole in our Canadian operation and my boss felt that I was just the cork to fill that hole. I think it is a promotion. Besides, Houston in the arm pit of the world. This city has few redeeming features. What it lacks in culture and sophistication it makes up for by its lack of clean air and any form of natural beauty. Actually, it isn't that bad. Houston has good restaurants, decent night life and the people are really friendly but given the choice I would much rather live in Calgary. In this business odds are that I will find myself back here sooner than later so might as well enjoy Canada while I can. Kerrie got engaged. Good for her. I have a cactus in my bathroom that is dying from lack of attention. I am not engaged. I was seeing someone for a while but she took a work assignment in Venezuela. No big loss. Too old for me anyway (31). Glad to hear that you are enjoying you time in NY. I am going to have to visit some time. I know I say that every time we chat but I really would like to try to get down there before you move on to your next destination. Or is NY home for a while? No Vacation plans other than that I am going to Matt and Jen's wedding this weekend. Should be a good party and I hung out with those guys quite a bit when I was living in Calgary. Also I am going to look for a place to live in Calgary in Friday. My friend Mohammed from TO is moving to Rotterdam to do his MBA so I might try to visit him in the spring. Do a little Amsterdam, Paris, London whirlwind tour.My family is doing great. My dad sold Titan to a Comglomerate from the US and is retiring in January and my mom is up to the same stuff. Dancing and buying shit for their house. Both of their health is great. My dad has been playing lots of golf and feeling great.How is Meg doing? Is she in Australia now? I should get in touch with her. I saw Reagan Neiss in commercial for her TV show last night. Good for her. I hope all goes well for her. Dan did go to D's wedding. Said it was really nice.

Margins on Enron's pretax operating earnings (whi=ch the company's earnings releases call IBIT, or income before interest, ta=xes and other items) are falling. Total IBIT of $795 million in the first q=uarter amounted to only 1.59% of the $50 billion in revenue for the period,= compared with a 2.08% margin in the fourth quarter and 4.75% in the year-e=arlier period. Revenue in the first quarter was nearly quadrupled from the =year-earlier period, yet IBIT rose only 27%. This shrinkage is due to lower=-margin trading income making up an increasingly large share of Enron's rev=enue base.

Illustrating this, first-quarter 2001 EPS of 49 cents was 23% ahea=d of the year-ago figure, even though the IBIT margin shrank by 3.2 percent=age points.

"Eventually it will be part of a competitive e=nvironment, but it'll take five to 10 years," says the analyst.

Cooper and I were out on one of our many walks and I thought I would say hi. Hope you are feeling better now. Saturday was fun. I shouldn't have gone to the bar. Ended up losing Max at the drink and going home. He was on a rant about his girlfriend and how women are all screwed up. I imagine he picked up some lonely girl. I would love to do lunch one day next week. Let me know when is good for you and if you like sushi. Take it easy.Chris
