maria.lebeau@enron.com,maria.lebeau@enron.com,maria.lebeau@enron.com,Subject: Good Morning,I need to ask a quick question.  I was trying to get Pam to get Hope to confirm Nov. 5th as my start date so that there wouldn't be any surprises.  Pam said that Hope gave her the OK to call Bill to discuss my transition date but he wasn't there so she had to leave him a message.  I'm not sure if that was yesterday or day before but they are speaking a little more openly about me leaving now and she mentioned that he hadn't returned her call.  I think they know that 3 weeks is a bit much so I think the call that she made to Bill is more less to make sure that he doesn't need me any earlier.  What do you think?  Give me a call please to let me know if there is anything else that I need to be doing at this time.Thanks,DanaX3-7520

Later after everything cools off and they ease up on the security we can use the instant messenger service. That church was a little slow compared to what I'm used too.  It might be due to the fact that they are an interracial congregation.  What is your friends name again that goes there?
