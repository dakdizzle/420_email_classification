I pointed out the two wheels that could be purchased real time, but this is not there obligation.Note:Steve (PPM) asked me @ 17:21 if Chelan still wants the energy ( I didn't know and Karen is gone at this time)Call me with any question,Craig 503.880.5303

I just haven't been able to make the time.  I was in Austin this past weekend for the UT football game, and I stayed with Bryan and Monica.  We went out on the lake on Sunday, and I went skiing.  It was fun.  I'm going to a Halloween party at my manager's house this Saturday.  Also, I've been dating as many girls as possible.  Ah, the single life.Clint

I remember those days about 3 years ago.  So that probably means you have a three day weekend, and are back on for days Monday.  That's just my guess.  As for the band I was playing, I really don't remember which CD I had in there, but it was probably Dexter Freebish or Vallejo.  They are both from Austin.  You need to call me when you get back on days.  I'm going to a Halloween party this weekend at my manager's house.  It should be fun.  Are you planning any more trips back to Houston?Clint

Make sure to repeat transmission requests with the BPA as "non-firm on Enron all the way".  Mistakes may cost as much as  $1200/mw if you agree to use Enron's firm rights.  Also note that some of BPA's network transmission fees have increased by $2.  C Dean
mike.curry@enron.com,mike.curry@enron.com,mike.curry@enron.com,Subject: Air Products load questions,X-FileName: CDEAN (Non-Privileged).pstMike,We need to know the volumes of their load and how it is broken down.  This would include location (by zone), ramp rates, and load factors.  Also, we need to know how fast the load can react to instructions, and how flexible the load is, i.e. can the load be moved up and down on an interval basis without causing problems?  We would also need to know their load forecast.  For example, when is the load available to be reduced, summers, on-peak, etc.?  Obviously if this is limited, we would want to value it accordingly.Thanks,Clint

jenniferp@acespower.com,jenniferp@acespower.com,jenniferp@acespower.com,Subject: RE:,What's up with your schedule?  You always seem to be working nights.  Things around here have been better.  We aren't very happy with what has happened to this co. over the past couple of months.  At least the rumors have stopped, and now we know what will become of Enron.  I'm just not sure how everyone will handle the change to Dynegy (or even if the merger will get completed).  Its not supposed to close until around Sept. '02.  So there is plenty of time for things to change even more around here.  As far as my job, at least I work in the power side.  We keep hearing that they bought us for our power and gas trading, so that makes me feel a little better.  I'm also glad that it is a Houston co. that bought us.  We are supposed to be moving into our new building this weekend, so that will be interesting.Have fun over Thanksgiving.
