Mike has been instru=mental to the Texas Desk.  With the sale of HPL, we were left with only one= scheduler with Texas experience.  Mike took on the responsibility that two= people were carrying prior to the sale of the pipeline (Waha scheduling). = He trained our new hire, Jay Smith, and assisted in developing scheduling =processes at the Katy Hub.  Prior to the sale of HPL, all of our activity a=t the Katy hub passed through the pipeline.  Mike used his knowledge of the= Waha hub and helped develop a net out procedure that allowed us to effecti=vely schedule our transactions.  Since June, Mike has handled the logistics= activities of the majority of Texas pipes (Westar, HPL, PGE, Channel, Oasi=s, Guadalupe).  Mike most outstanding accomplishment is the over $30,000 he= saved us in hub transport fees from July to November.  In July, I began tr=acking the amount of hub fees that we should have to pay in the Waha area (=on EOL we transacted on the basis that the seller pays the transport fees t=hrough the hub).  Mike used his knowledge of the pipes, his business relati=onships, and his negotiation skills to decrease the amount of gas that we s=cheduled under our contracts.  In essence, I kept a sort of P&L for him.  M=ike has taken the desks responsibilities upon himself, as if this were his =business.  With the limited number of people on our desk, I needed to split= my time between Logistics and Trading.  Truthfully, I spent the majority o=f my time with the trading.  Mike handled the daily logistics responsibilit=ies.  He acted as lead, supervising and training Jay, our other team member=.  Mike performed at a senior level since his first month with the desk.  M=ike came to the desk with experience on the pipeline side of the business, =accepting nominations and confirming the plants and interconnects. He came =to the Texas desk and exceeded all of my expectations. He has advanced quic=ker than any of the schedulers I've seen.  In fact, he has gone from very m=inimal marketing logistics knowledge to explaining transactions and process=es to other people in the industry with more experience than him.  In short=, Mike has been the heart of the Texas Logistics team.  His abilities and h=ard work have reduced our transport fees, kept our headcount low (he has fu=lfilled the responsibilities of two people), and enabled the Texas Desk to =close time sensitive deals and transact in increasingly complicated deals. = Mike is a superior employee.  His knowledge, ability, and hard work are es=sential to the success of the Texas Desk.  Please support him with a promot=ion.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need any information.= =20Thanks.Daren

However, we have been transporting the gas under ENA.  This is primarily for spot and base deals.  We want to keep these transport contracts with ENA.  The only term deal we have at Waha is to Tufco (0-60,000/day).  This deal is under ENA with it's own firm transport contract (now on Guadalupe Pipeline, which was previously Teco/PGEV).  The sale and transport will go with HPL.  The sale to Entex off of Oasis (currently under the ENA, will be assigned to HPL) must be served off of Oasis.  So HPL will need to acquire an Oasis contract for this deal.  Let me know if you have any more questions.D

He started out the doorway, but came back in and walked behind me.  I =just kept working, thinking that he was watching me.  Then I noticed out of= the corner of my eye that he had moved closer to me.  When I turned to loo=k, I just lost my breath.

We cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in Texas.  This, of course, is due to the bankruptcy.  As a result, we are not able to sale Tenaska's excess fuel.  We did contact Brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a Gas Daily price, but they do not want it (gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while).  In December, we had to cut 10,000/day from the 7th through the 27th.  For January, we haven't had to cut yet, but I am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future.2)  For November activity (which was settled in Dec), ENA owes Tenaska IV for the excess supply that we sold.  However, due to the bankruptcy, we could not make payments out.  ENA could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline.  James Armstrong paid the counterparties directly.  I think that he should continue to do this for Dec and Jan.  We should not transfer any funds from Tenaska IV to ENA.I don't know how Enron's ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding.  But we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management.Please give me a call or e-mail me.  We can get together sometime Thurs or Fri morning.D

I was on vacation last week, th=rough Monday.  Not a good feeling coming back to a sub $20 stock price and =an SEC inquiry.  It never really seemed possible to me that Enron would be =here.  Other than concerns for my future, everything is going fine.  Things= really are ok, I know I can get a job with AEP if I need to.  I actually s=tarted talking to them about it.  But on Wednesday, they made a few changes= that I'm not so sure about.  Ed Gottlob (recently made VP) was put over th=e origination desk.  (I heard that they weren't too pleased with Ducoti and= Bilberry.)  With that move, they needed someone else to run the trading de=sk.  That person is our fast-talking friend, Carey Metz.  That blew me away=.  I believe their thought was that he would be the best to manage the fina=ncial risk.  Apparently he's made a ton of money since he's been in Columbu=s.  He's also going to stay in Columbus with this responsibility.  So, this= may be the first move to bring the group up north with the rest of the fam=ily.The home-life is going well.  We have 3 year-old soccer every Sat.  My love=ly wife signed me up to be the coach.  I'm going to get her for that one.  =It is fun, though.  Those kids are funny.  They don't care where the ball g=oes, they just keep kicking (even through the woods).  Looking forward to H=alloween.  Cole is going to be a policeman, Jake is going to be a jailbird/=prisoner.  Cole has already handcuffed Jake a number of times, he loves it.=  My vacation last week was very good.  It was the first extended vacation =that I have taken where we didn't have traveling and entertainment stuff pl=anned.  It was one of the best vacations I have had.  We spent 2 days in Sa=n Antonio doing the zoo and easy stuff like that.  The rest of the week, we= did things around here (like Children's Museum).Big game coming up this weekend.

I have changed the price on Deal 1109140 from $0.00 to $2.455.  From what I understand, we received the gas at King Ranch, sold it to AEP so that they would move it through the header on their contract and bought it back at a half cent difference.  Following that, we sold the gas to the central desk, who sold it to Oneok at the South Texas pool.  With the changes I made and the entries you are able to do, hopefully this deal will be wrapped up.  Let me know if you need me to do anything else.D

Stacey did leave, so I am back to trading Waha.  However, it's going a lot better this time.  I am actualy enjoying it somewhat.  With the majority of the desk leaving, I am looking into moving into the day trading arena for the new Texas Desk.  We'll see how that goes.  Bidweek was kinda rough this time.  In addition to Stacey leaving during the middle of the week, we have some major outages on the A/S line where we have to stay balanced on Texoma and balanced on the south end.  The line has been split into two seperate systems.  Handling that has been a constant battle.  Plus, with the pending sale, people just don't care as much about the business.  It's a little harder to get things done.Anyway, things are going pretty good at the house.  But, the list of things to fix and do keeps getting longer and longer.  We are extremely busy.  The kids are loving the stairs.  You ought to see Jake go down.  We taught him to turn around backwards and crawl down the stairs on his belly.  Well, that was too slow for him.  Now, he get's on his belly, feet up in the air, and slides down, barely skiming the stairs.  He looks a penguin sliding down a snow bank, except on his stomach.  Cole is doing his best to either run Jake off or make him tough.  Cole runs over Jake with his toys, pushes Jake out the way, or just walks right over him.  It doesn't affect Jake, though, he gets right back up and keeps on going.Anyway, I need to get back to work.  Hope the family is doing well.  Maybe you can come down for lunch next week.

Please change the demand fee on deal 384258 from $3,841,888.11 to $3,830,131.18.Also, I spoke to TXU about the rate on contract 1856 (deal 452475).  They have been billing us $0.11 and we have $0.10.  The extra cent is for the El Paso header fee.  The pricing you gave me is for contract 1671, but also has the header fee if you look on page 5 of 6.  You'll see a a section called "Compression & Header Expense if Utilized".  The current rate for 1856 is $0.01 and 0% fuel.
