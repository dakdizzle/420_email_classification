ScottX31455Parking & Transportation@ENRON03/28/2001 04:07 PMSubject:	Enron Center GarageThe Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. (You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)<Embedded StdOleLink>

I can't tell you how much my life has changed in the last three weeks.  I'm getting out of the office no later than 6:30 everyday (and it's usually closer to 4:30-5:00) and I actually have time to do other things with my life.  I went to the symphony last week, am going to a reception at the MFA next week, joined a volunteer organization geared toward young professionals and am thinking about joining the church I've been going to the last couple of months.  All in all life has improved.  Still nothing new on the guy front, but I'm in no rush so it's not that big a deal.I am so excited about my trip out to San Diego to see you.  I promise to be well rested and ready to shop, eat and go out....or just sit on the beach.  Like I said before, I'm up for anything.  Hope things are going well with you, the job and Brendan.  Drop me a line if you get a chance and let me know what's new in your life.Talk to you soon,Susan

cscott_korea@yahoo.com,cscott_korea@yahoo.com,cscott_korea@yahoo.com,Subject: Long time, no talk....,Hey guys,Thought I'd drop you a line and catch up on life.  If I'm not mistaken you're actually in Australia right now doing all kinds of fun and active things, so you probably won't get this for a few days.  I can't tell you how glad I am that you've had a chance to take advantage of all the travel possibilities on that side of the world ( and not just a little jealous).  I think all of these experiences are going to leave you with some incredible memories of your time in South Korea.  As for myself, this weekend will mark only the second in the last month and a half or so that I will be spending in Houston.  I figured by now I'd be traveled out but I can't get enough.  The Caymans were incredible...we ate at great restaurants (not Bed unfortunately, but I did see it), got to go scuba diving off the east end and swam with a slew of stingrays.  Actually, I was holding onto/bonding with one of the stingrays, just floating with the current, for about 5 minutes until I had to gently shove it off and swim back into safe proximity of the boat.  It was a completely surreal experience.  Plus, the trip solidified my appreciation and fondness for the new job, and more specifically the new co-workers, which is never a bad thing.Speaking of the new job, things are going well.  I still have a ton to learn but I have a feeling that will be the case for a long time to come.  There is just an overwhelming amount of information, not to mention strategies and nuances to learn about gas trading as a whole and in particular the western region of the US.  I've been actively trading for well over a month now and am getting to know all the players in my market as well as gaining confidence with each additional trade.  So far so good though...I'm definitely glad I made the choice to stay in Houston and take on this role.I had a pledge sister's wedding in San Antonio a few weeks ago, which was fun, and another "sister's" wedding this weekend here in Houston.  I tell you, it's out-of-control with all of my friend's weddings & engagements.  Two weekends ago I got hit with 3, yes you heard correctly 3, new engagements of close friends.  I am very rapidly becoming out-numbered on this front.  Still, the only thing that crosses my mind each time I hear of a new one, aside from being thrilled for the happy couple of course, is that I am a ways off from such an endeavor myself.  I just have the feeling I've got a lot of changing to do in the next year or two (or more) and am not sure that what I'd want now is what I'll want then.  Okay, change of subject...getting to deep.Two weekends ago I went with a few of the traders from the desk to Las Vegas.  We went to meet some of our power traders from Portland to discuss west energy issues and to try and squeeze in a little fun.  Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, I think we managed to squeeze in more than a little fun.  I think my earliest arrival back at the hotel room that weekend was around 6:30 am.  I don't know if it's the oxygen they constantly pump into the clubs and casinos or the steady flow of free drinks, but you really do lose all track of time there.  I feel certain any duration longer that a weekend would either kill me or force me to take another vacation just to recover.  I managed to walk away only $40 bucks in the hole so all in all I was feeling pretty good.What the future holds? - I'm planning a trip to London in early June to visit Emily and then she comes back to Houston for about a month, so I'm really looking forward to that.  And, I'm still trying to figure out when I'm going to come visit you guys...I was thinking August, given your trip to Hawaii in July and my trip to London in June, so let me know your thoughts.  September is also an option if that works better for you.  I think I'll try to take 6 or 7 work days off so that we could travel while I'm over there if we wanted to and so we'd have two weekends.  Anyway, it's obviously still in the incubation phase.Hope the trip was a rousing success and I'll talk to you soon,Sue

Anyway, got an email from Emily this morning and she said another trip should be planned to go over in Sept/Oct when the airfares are dirt cheap.  I'm guessing I'll probably be up for going again by that time if you don't mind waiting that long.  My guess is we could get tickets for somewhere around $350 or $400.  I think I found a flight for June (probably the 5th - 12th), but I'm going to end up spending somewhere around $600.  Let me know what you think.Sue

As for the lease, brought up the subject and it went pretty much no where.  Discovered we could sign a year lease and if she decides to up and go I can move into a one bedroom if I give the complex 30 days notice...which is what I'm figuring we'll end up doing.  I also told her that I got my airplane ticket through council travel on British Airways leaving the 5th and returning the 12th (via email yesterday) and she didn't mention it last night.  Who knows?  I'm not going to mention it anymore, it's up to her.  And ditto on the witty repartee.

Truth be told, however, of late much of my reading mat=erial has been natural gas related and although the industry is riveting, I='m not sure that is exactly the kind of entertainment you had in mind.  How=ever, I did read a book a few months ago that you might find rather interes=ting.

There are also a couple of other books I'm in the process of read=ing right now:  Galileo's Daughter : A Historical Memoir of Science, Faith,= and Love and Eleanor of Aquitaine : A Life.  The Galileo book is a little =slow to start, but has tons of interesting historical references, as does E=leanor of Aquitaine.  If I remember correctly, you always had a bit of a fo=ndness for history.  I also read Memoirs of a Geisha last fall and couldn't= put it down, although I have talked to others who didn't find it as enjoya=ble.

Once you're on the Just for Fun page click on Derby 2001 and go to the last picture on the first row.  You can read the names from there.  Hope the first day at the new office is going well.  Give me a call sometime and let me know what the scoop is regarding Wednesday and the baseball game.  I'm anxious to hear if you talked to Leslie again after the cryptic phone call on Saturday.Suebtw....not only no contact, but not said individual's not even logging into messenger...I think this where people tend to say "stick a fork in it."

I will try and give you a call later on today or tonight to talk in person, but I wanted to let you know ASAP that I will gladly participate in any way possible in the pre-wedding and wedding day activities.  This really is such an exciting time in your life and I look forward to all of the festivities.Love,SuePS - Trish Murphy is playing tomorrow night at the Mucky Duck if you have any interest.

Also, I'm dying to hear about the Jonatha Brooks concert.  I had planned on going, but a high school friend's bachelorette party conflicted.

I had no idea you were so fragile, you hide it well.  Life at Enron is good but things have been pretty busy the last couple weeks.  I went to New Braunfels last Friday to visit one of Lisa and my friends (actually it's the girl we visited in London) and then had a wedding to go to Saturday night.  No big plans for the 4th as of yet.  I'm still trying to figure out where I'm going to be...could be Houston, Austin or Georgetown.  I know, I know...I'm such a jet-setter.  How about yourself?  Planning another famous Boone BBQ.  Cooking commences at 3:00 am, right?  Hope you're having a nice day.

I know I'm an old bitty, but that is just too late to be calling a working girl when you're looking for a date Wednesday or Thursday night.  Anyway, I will give him a call this afternoon but I might suggest we just do something when he gets back from his trip.

The answer is no.With regard to state agencies or municipalities, section 201(f) of the Fede=ral Power Act ("FPA") states that no provision of Part II of the FPA, which= governs the regulation of electric utility companies engaged in interstate= commerce, "shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United States, a S=tate or any political subdivision of a state, or any agency, authority, or =instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or any corporation whi=ch is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or more of the foreg=oing, or any officer, agent, employee of any of the foregoing acting as suc=h in the course of his official duty, unless such provision makes specific =reference thereto."Section 205 of the FPA, which would would otherwise require an entity to ha=ve rates for wholesale sales of power on file with FERC, does not apply to =state agencies and municipalities.With regard to whether QFs need power marketing authorization, most QFs are= exempt (some small power production facilities are not exempt) from most p=rovisions of the FPA, including section 205, which requires public utilitie=s making sales of electric energy for resale in interstate commerce to file= rate schedules with FERC.  QFs are instead regulated under PURPA, which au=thorizes utilities to purchase power from QFs at the purchaser's avoided co=st.  FERC decisional precedent indicates that a QF can lawfully sell at mar=ket-based rates without seeking market-based rate authorization from FERC, =but that it may nevertheless be prudent for a QF to seek FERC acceptance of= a market-based rate schedule that would provide protection in the event QF= status is lost.Let me know if you need anything else.Andrea M.

The answer is no.With regard to state agencies or municipalities, section 201(f) of the Fede=ral Power Act ("FPA") states that no provision of Part II of the FPA, which= governs the regulation of electric utility companies engaged in interstate= commerce, "shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United States, a S=tate or any political subdivision of a state, or any agency, authority, or =instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or any corporation whi=ch is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or more of the foreg=oing, or any officer, agent, employee of any of the foregoing acting as suc=h in the course of his official duty, unless such provision makes specific =reference thereto."Section 205 of the FPA, which would would otherwise require an entity to ha=ve rates for wholesale sales of power on file with FERC, does not apply to =state agencies and municipalities.With regard to whether QFs need power marketing authorization, most QFs are= exempt (some small power production facilities are not exempt) from most p=rovisions of the FPA, including section 205, which requires public utilitie=s making sales of electric energy for resale in interstate commerce to file= rate schedules with FERC.  QFs are instead regulated under PURPA, which au=thorizes utilities to purchase power from QFs at the purchaser's avoided co=st.  FERC decisional precedent indicates that a QF can lawfully sell at mar=ket-based rates without seeking market-based rate authorization from FERC, =but that it may nevertheless be prudent for a QF to seek FERC acceptance of= a market-based rate schedule that would provide protection in the event QF= status is lost.Let me know if you need anything else.Andrea M.

Lisa said you'd broken your foot recently and have been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're riding public transportation.  Anyway, I was writing to see if you might have some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in Seattle.  One of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend in your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.  I hope you're still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.  It looks like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good thing for you.  I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to live in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit of a research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions for restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great, and maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink.Thanks a bunch,Susan

We get in around 10:30 on Thursday night and flight out very late on Sunday.  At present we have reservations at the Mayflower Inn, but are debating taking a trip to the San Juan's (possibly overnight - do you have an opinion on that?...i.e. can it be just a day trip).  Discovery Park sounds great....we are both very interested in doing as much outdoors as possible.  To that end, we were thinking about doing some kayaking if you know of any particularly good places.  I really hope we get a chance to meet up while I'm in town...you may want to give me your phone number so we can contact you once we're in town.Thanks again,Susan

Sorry about the pulled muscle.  What exactly does that do to the marathon plans?  Will you be able to compete still, or are you just going to hit all the wine stops now?  I think you're right about Katy's move to Dallas. I have a feeling she's actually going to really like being there and working.  I pretty sure the folks are still helping out with living expenses, etc. so she won't have to make too big of an adjustment right off the bat.  As for me, Seattle could definitely be a destination but it would require a job change.  Enron doesn't have any offices up there.  The closest office is Portland and for obvious and now unavoidable reasons I don't see a move there any time soon.  You are right about not being able to go wrong with a place possessing Austin-like qualities...they are highly desirable.I will most certainly try to keep the September date open...it would be great to see Britney and Arden.  We had Susan E.'s bachelorette party Saturday night (plus a bridal shower earlier that day).  Lisa hosted Laura White's at the apartment the same night.  I got to see and visit with Jenny Kenair (sp?), Janie Pitman, Rachel Pack among others.  Very interesting.  The two bachelorette parties met up at Black Swan for late night dancing.  Lis was in rare form.  I knew it was bad when she ran up and started hugging me....I think she almost crushed Susan and Kelly.  Anyway, it was actually pretty fun and I've decided I really like Susan's sister Betsy...good sense of humor and not at all be-boppy.  I did manage to trick her into doing the V-I-C-T-O-R-Y cheer at Black Swan though.  I thought it was pretty darn funny myself...she was mortified when she realized I'd got her to do a cheer.Once again...best of luck banging out your opus.

I've actually been in Denver all week for a Natural Gas Convention.  As for Labor Day weekend, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to make it.  I'm leaving for S. Korea next Tuesday and don't get back until the weekend before Labor Day weekend.  So issue one is, will I have enough energy to make the trip?  The other issue is a friend's wedding in Park City that same weekend.  I'd feel bad skipping her wedding but still going on a trip.  So.....I was thinking maybe it'd be better all around if I came a different weekend.  Why don't you take a look at your calendar and let me know what other dates in September look good to you.Susan

A large numbe=r of people we do business with are based in NY and have lost countless fri=ends and colleagues in the WTC's destruction.  Chuck has some pledge brothe=r's who are working up there, but we've heard that both of them are okay.==20I wish you were back home as well....I was on the phone with my Mom off and= on all day yesterday and I must say it would've been nice to been back hom=e on the couch with her.  I did talk to Jen yesterday worried about LA and =what was going on there, but she was fine as well.  She said they'd shut do=wn the airport and several major roads surrounding it, but nothing else of =concern.We evacuated the Enron building around 9:30 yesterday morning...it was disc=oncerting.  I walked down the 32 flights of stairs to get to my parking gar=age and had only one desire...to get out of downtown.  There were rumors fl=ying that Houston was another target and given the size of our building, ou=r international presence (esp. in regards to oil/natural gas) and our CEO's= connections to the President...I think everyone figured Enron would be a l=ogical target.  Fortunately, those fears were unfounded.On a lighter note...I'm very anxious to hear all about your marathon experi=ence...including the trip there.  Sounds like it was a doozey.Love ya,Sue

Facts on Figures; There are 3  billion women who don't look like supermodels and only eight who do.  Marilyn Monroe wore a size 14.[IMAGE]If Barbie was a real woman, she'd have to walk on all fours due to  her proportions. The average woman weighs 144 lb. and wears between a  12-14. One out of every four college aged women has an eating!  disorder.[IMAGE]The models in the  magazines are airbrushed -- not perfect! A psychological study in 1995  found that three minutes spent looking at a fashion magazine caused 70% of  women to feel depressed, guilty, and shameful.   Models  twenty years ago weighed 8% less than the average woman.[IMAGE]Today they weigh 23%  less.[IMAGE]~Beauty of a Woman~  The beauty  of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, The  figure she carries, or the way she combs her hair. The  beauty of a woman must be seen from her eyes, Because that  is the doorway to her heart, The place where love resides.  The beauty of a woman Is not in a facial mole,  But true beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul.  It is the caring that she lovingly gives,  The passion that she shows. The beauty  of a woman With passing years -- only  grows.[IMAGE]An English professor  wrote the words, "Woman without her man is nothing," on the blackboard and  directed the students to punctuate it correctly.

She's hopelessly old-fashioned. 18  YEARS OF AGE ~ That old woman? She's way out of date! 25  YEARS OF AGE ~ Well, she might know a little bit about it.  35 YEARS OF AGE ~ Before we decide, let's get Mom's opinion.  45 YEARS OF AGE ~ Wonder what Mom would have thought about  it? 65 YEARS OF AGE ~ Wish I could talk it over with Mom.  ***Please send this to at least  five phenomenal women today in celebration of Women's History Month.

The allocation process I do not think =is the problem. It is the way the rates are used today for PNR. Today, the =only rates I think that are loaded in CBS are the posted rates and the tari=ff rates. If you want the rate to carry through at the contract level for t=he range of dates of the specific deal, then the rates must be loaded that =way in CBS for each PNR deal that is granted prior to the timely allocation= process. If the allocation does not find a contract specific rate, then it= looks for the next level which is your posted rates, if no posted rates ar=e found, then it looks for tariff rates on PNR. It sounds like to me that T=W will need to implement specific deal sheets and calculate the specific ra=tes for each deal sheet on a daily basis & load the total specific contract= deal rate in CBS.  Please let me know if there are other problems in the a=llocation process itself.Thanks Ramona

The reason I'm writing, actually, is because I left something at the church the night of the wedding.  I thought it had been taken to the country club but the wedding co-ordinators didn't have it.  Basically, it was a white plastic bag with a little kids t-shirt and a little girls shorts & tank top outfit (along with a little hand painted picture).  I bought the clothes in the Caymans for my niece and nephew, so ideally I like to track them down.  I was hoping you could tell me who I should contact about items left in the bridesmaid's room in the church.  I think the bag said The Wharf on the outside if that helps at all.Thanks,Sue

I had a kitchen shower/luncheon and a bar shower/party saturday in san antonio.  went out friday night with emily till about 2:30 am...perfect NW houston evening, donaraki (sp?) and Matthias's, got up saturday morning at 6am then drove to SA, out until about 3am saturday night, then up and in austin by 11am...brunch with corey then off to kathy and travis's, left austin around 7:30 and got home a little after 10pm...needless to say i'm exhausted today.as for the job front....i was 1st runner up for the job with Puget.  they ended up offering it to a guy with more trading experience (go figure, someone with more than 1 yr of experience..ha), had he turned down the offer i would have been packing my bags but unfortunately for me he accepted.  as for ENE, i was offered a position with the new UBS trading organization but decided to decline the offer, i've come to the conclusion that i just need to make a clean break from this place.  i'm actually headed to seattle again this thursday to interview with another natural gas company up there.  it's a small company (around 450) and the job is for a scheduler not a trader, but i've got a good feeling about the place right now.  they strike me as nice people which seems to go a long way these days.  so, i'll arrive thursday evening, interview friday and fly back monday...they said they wanted to give me time to explore the city and look for housing etc., which is nice.if all of this works out it looks as though i could be in seattle as early as march...WOW!hope all is still going well with you.  i've been so happy to get your emails and know that this experience is turning out to be a good one for you.  talk to you soon,Suebtw....i got our deposit back from the apartment complex.  i'll just write you a check for your half and drop it off at your mom's house.

We went out to dinner in Nashville both Friday and Saturday night, and spent the day walking around downtown on Saturday.  Chuck drove me around the Army base and showed me a bit of the area where they live.  We also went to this Botanical Garden/Museum called Cheekwood...it's the estate of the Maxwell Coffee fortune.  Anyway, it was fun and very relaxing.  They're house is really cute and their neighborhood requires at least a 1/3 an acre for each house...so there's lots of land.I haven't made a decision about the Seattle job yet, I actually have until the end of next week to give them my answer.  In the meantime I've been talking to some headhunters and checking out any other options that may be out there.  At this point there is really no telling where in the U.S. I'm ultimately going to end up...which I personally find kind of fun.We got a total of $350 out of the $400 deposit back (not too bad).  I just deposited the check so all I need to do is drop off a check for $175 to your Mom...which I will do this weekend.Hope things are still going well there!Keep me posted,Sue

After speaking with everyone Thursday it became obvious to me that there are some real opportunities and room for growth with Cinergy right now.  It was also apparent that it is going to take a good deal of hard work and the ability to tackle many variant tasks to achieve those aims.  To that end, let me reiterate to you my willingness to take on a host of responsibilities to aid in that process.  As I expressed to you at lunch, my goal is to obtain the skills and tools that will make me a consistent and effective trader.  I left the offices Thursday with the impression that Cinergy, and those with whom I interviewed, could help me to accomplish those objectives.

I've been meaning to write and ask what you think of the food there (although, obviously you are surviving).  Please tell Priya, "Congratulations!!!!" for me...that is awesome.  I was actually looking into that program the other day, so on a selfish note I'm really curious to see what she thinks of the school, etc.  I think it'd be awesome to work in D.C. (or Boston or Northern California for that matter).  You should definitely keep rolling with the momentum you've got going right now...run with it!  And, good luck trying to arrange the trip w/ Niclas.  If you do manage to go...just have fun (it doesn't have to be "it", it can just be fun).I have an offer in KC right now, should be getting the formal offer from Cincinnati next week and still waiting to hear from Chicago.  So things are definitely happening.  I'm just struggling with this decision a bit and have a real tug to head to France or Switzerland for 6 months to become fluent in French (you think I'm kidding, but I've really been checking this stuff out).  Part of the reason for my seemingly flaky turn is because of a recent sad event.  Chris went into premature labor on Tuesday (she was about 6 mos along) and the baby didn't make it.  She had a heart beat when she was born, but it was very weak.  They tried to resuscitate her but after about 15 minutes Chuck and Chris told the doctors to let her go.  Her name was Kelly Elizabeth Scott.  My Mom and Chris's Mom flew out to TN on Tuesday and my Dad went out there Wednesday...they are managing, but it's been really tough.  Chris is fine health-wise which we are all very thankful for, but everyone is really just trying to come to grips with why this happened.  So say a little prayer for them if you can.I miss you too (you were actually in my dream last night) and really hope you're enjoying yourself.  Take care and I'll talk to you soon.Sue

As Chair Herbert said:  SPP should have read the Commission's order in May and taken it more seriously.  (Issues for possible rehearing are ****).?	The Commission declined to approve SPP's scope and configuration because the SPP members remain uncommitted to the RTO and have not made a decision to transfer operational control and the SPP/Entergy relationship remains somewhat undefined.  The Commission wants to see evidence of serious efforts to form RTOs that combine current RTO proposals and Entergy and SPP must file a report by May 25 addressing this scope issue.	o	Bulk power sales and purchase figures indicate that natural markets extend beyond the SPP RTO borders.  There are significant sales and purchases between SPP and SERC (and Midwest companies to a lesser extent.)	o	Expect the existing TOs to file Section 203 applications to transfer control of transmission to SPP.	o	MOU must be clarified to demonstrate that the minimum requirements of an RTO, such as operational authority, ATC calculation and planning/expansion, will be met.?	Approves Entergy's proposal for a Managing Member that controls all voting rights to the Transco and approves Entergy's Board approval process (states that Entergy would control no more than two of the selection committee's seven members). ?	Allows Southwestern Public Service Company to satisfy its merger obligation by joining SPP instead of MISO.?	The Commission did not address EPMI's motion to condition market based rate authority on RTO participation.******

Florida should probably be separate.  SPP could be in this RTO or the Midwest.  Therefore, the overall theme that Jim discussed this morning (that FERC has started something somewhat positive, but should take the step to actually state that it wants these utilities to work toward one SE RTO) can be put into the GridSouth and Southern request for rehearing (Tom C. is getting the draft of this.)

Either works for me.  The packages I'm looking at are about and hour and a half long and I thought to buy you some more time I could just visit all the shops.  Here are the two packages I'm looking at...what do you think?  (The lady at the spa recommended the second one)Fruit Body Facial: A double-exfoliating facial for the entire body leaving the skin feeling silky smooth and shining -- ideal before a wedding or a special occasion that's just right for that backless dress. You are first exfoliated with crushed Californian grape seeds followed by a light misting with an orange blossom aromatherapy oil. After a brief shower, you'll enjoy an all-over message with a facial quality message lotion. Then it's your choice of either an invigorating peppermint glycolic or a calming aloe vera/grapefruit finishing skin treatment.Benefits: Skin feels rejuvenated and healthy; circulation is stimulated and the skin has a healthy glow.Time: 90 minutesPacific Paradise Body Scrub& Massage: Pineapple papaya lotion is the moisturizer and California grape seeds - nature's anti-oxidant - are the exfoliant in this 20 - 25 minute body scrub. You'll feel like island Royalty as warm coconut kuki oil is used as the lotion during a 50-minute message that completes the treatment.Benefits: Rough skin disappears as the powerful moisturizing properties of tropical oils sink deep into your skin.Time: 90 minutesTa Ta,Susan

Unfortunately, I'm no longer moving to London.  I was offered a job here in Houston trading and just couldn't pass it up.  However, I will definitely tell my friend Emily about the flat...she's always looking for ways to save a little bit of money.  I'll also keep my ears open for any Enronites who are looking for places to live.Actually, the reason I was going to email you was to let you know I'm coming over to visit again this June.  I will be in town basically the 6th through the 11th (flying in on the 5th and departing the 12th).  I hope you're in town at least some of that time...I'm still frustrated we never had a chance to hook-up last time.  Food for thought...there's an Eagles concert on the 9th and my friend already has tickets with some buddies... I'm was planning on just getting a single ticket and hopefully squeezing in with them, but if you have any interest please let me know and we could just get tickets together.
